= Looking Beyond Ada and Using Arbitrary Custom Tokens

In previous examples, whenever a `Value` was required,
we have exclusively used Ada.
This makes a lot of sense,
seeing as Ada is the fundamental currency supported by Cardano.

Plutus offers a more general concept of _value_, though,
supporting custom fungible, non-fungible, and mixed tokens
// TODO: this link should be to the section inside the chapter,
// but see https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-epub3/issues/202
(see <<04-smartcont#04-smartcont>>),
and in this chapter, we want to demonstrate how to go beyond Ada
and work with other tokens.

What is a `Value` in Plutus?

[source,haskell]
----
newtype Value = Value
    {getValue :: Map CurrencySymbol (Map TokenName Integer)}
----

Types `CurrencySymbol` and `TokenName` are both simple wrappers around
`ByteString`.

This notion of _value_ encompasses Ada, fungible tokens, non-fungible tokens, and
more exotic mixed cases:

* Ada has the _empty bytestring_ as `CurrencySymbol` and `TokenName`.
* A _fungible_ token is represented by a `CurrencySymbol` for which there is
  exactly one `TokenSymbol` which can have an arbitrary non-negative quantity (of which Ada is a
  special case).
* A class of _non-fungible_ tokens is a `CurrencySymbol` with several ``TokenName``s,
  each of which has a quantity of one. Each of these names corresponds to one
  unique non-fungible token.
* Mixed tokens are those with several ``TokenName``s _and_ quantities greater
  than one.

In this chapter, we look at the example of a _fungible_ token.
In fact, we will forge our own currency, _Plutus_, and show how to trade with it.

For custom tokens, the question of how to _forge_ them arises:
How do such tokens come into existence in the first place?

Technically, this happens with the `txForge` field of the `Tx` type:

[source,haskell]
----
data Tx = Tx
    { txInputs     :: Set TxIn
    , txOutputs    :: [TxOut]
    , txForge      :: Value
    , txFee        :: Ada
    , txValidRange :: SlotRange
    , txSignatures :: Map PubKey Signature
    }
----

For a transaction to be _valid_, the sum of input values _and_ `txForge`
must equal the sum of output values and `txFee`,
so by having a transaction with a positive value for `txForge`,
we "create" value.

Obviously, we cannot allow an arbitrary transaction to have a positive
`txForge` value. If we did, everybody could create value out of thin air at any
time.

The forging of
Ada on the Cardano blockchain was done in the genesis block.
But how do we forge tokens other than Ada?

IMPORTANT: The rule is that if a transaction has a non-zero `txForge` value,
then for _every currency symbol in that value_,
there must be a script input whose validator script hash equals that currency
symbol.

This allows us to encode a _monetary policy_ for custom tokens,
where the validator script defines this policy,
by using the hash of that script as the currency symbol for our token.

In our example, we want a very simple monetary policy: The _issuer_ of the token
can forge as many tokens as she likes, but nobody else can.

Let us start by defining the type `Fungible` representing this policy:

include::fungible.adoc[]

Finally, we can test all of this in the Playground: We have wallet #1 forge
twenty units of a new currency called "Plutus", then trade ten of those for 5
Ada with wallet #2:

image:token-actions2.png[]

image:token-result1.png[]

image:token-result2.png[]

image:token-result3.png[]

As expected, wallet #1 ends up with 15 Ada and 10 Plutus,
and wallet #2 ends up with 5 Ada and 10 Plutus.

And here is what the whole sequence looks like on the blockchain: The first
transaction by Alice, owner of wallet #1, creates to script output with the
monetary policy for Plutus. Her second transaction forges 20 Plutus. Then she
locks 10 Plutus in the trade script with Bob, owner of wallet #2, who locks the
price of 5 Ada into that script as well. The final transaction executes the
trade.

This concludes this chapter. We have learned how to go beyond Ada and use
arbitrary custom tokens, how forging new tokens works, and how we can trade them
securely.
