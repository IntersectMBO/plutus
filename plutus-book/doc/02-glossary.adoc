Extended UTxO ::
* The ledger model on which the Plutus Platform is based
* In particular, transactions may contain Plutus scripts to be executed by the nodes

On-chain code ::
* Code written as part of a smart contract which executes on the chain during transaction validation
- This code is

Off-chain code ::
* Code written as part of a smart contract which executes off the chain, usually in a user's wallet.

Plutus Core ::
* A small functional programming language designed to run as on-chain code.

Plutus IR ::
* An intermediate language that compiles to Plutus Core, for use as a target language for compiler writers.

Plutus Platform ::
* The combined software support for writing smart contracts, including:
- Libraries for writing off-chain code in Haskell.
- Libraries for writing on-chain code in Plutus Tx.
- Emulator support for testing smart contracts.

Plutus Tx ::
* A subset of Haskell which is compiled into Plutus Core.

Non-fungible Token ::
* A token that is not interchangeable with other tokens,
- I.e. its value cannot be expressed in terms of other tokens, such as cryptocurrency, and thus has no fixed price
