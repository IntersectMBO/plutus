[#parameters]
= A Contract with Parameters

After our simple working example of a short game in the last chapter,
let us now try something more ambitious and realistic, to
run a _crowdsourcing campaign_.

In such a campaign, the _owner_ of the campaign sets a _funding target_,
an _end date_ and a _collection deadline_.

_Contributors_ can then give funds to the campaign until the end date.
If the total of all contributions reaches the funding target,
the owner has time to collect all contributions before the collection deadline.
If the target has not been reached, or if the owner fails to collect the funds
before the deadline, contributors can reclaim their contributions after the
deadline.

So for example, let us say that the owner of wallet #1 runs a campaign with
a funding target of 12 Ada, an end date slot of #10, and a collection deadline of #20.
Let us further assume that wallet #2 contributes 7 Ada to this campaign
and that wallet #3 contributes 6 Ada,
and that both make their contributions before slot #10.

Then the campaign was successful, and wallet #1 has time to collect
the total of 7 + 6 = 13 Ada before slot #20.

If wallet #1 does _not_ claim these funds before slot #20, wallet #2 can reclaim
7 Ada, wallet #3 can reclaim 6 Ada.

If, on the other hand only wallet #2 contributes 7 Ada, and wallet #3 does
not contribute at all, the funding target is not reached, and the campaign is a
failure. In this case, wallet #1 cannot collect any funds, and wallet #2 can
reclaim 7 Ada in slot #20, or later.

So how do we run such a campaign using Plutus?

First, we want our script to be _parameterizable_ by
the configuration data explained above, namely the _owner_, _funding target_,
_end date_ and _collection deadline_. This way the script will be reusable
for many different campaigns.

So the first thing we do is define a type which represents these
parameters:

include::crowd.adoc[]

And that is it! We are now ready to test our code in the Playground.
One slight problem is that in order to provide the `Campaign` argument for the
`contribute` endpoint, we need to know the campaign owner's public key. 
The following table of all Playground wallets and their public keys will be
helpful:

We begin with a successful campaign owned by wallet #1 with a funding target of
12 Ada, an end date of slot #10 and a collection deadline of slot #20.

As expected, wallet #1 can collect the contributions of 13 Ada at the end date:

Let us now simulate the same campaign when it fails, because wallet #3 only
contributes 4 Ada:

In this case, the contributor's wallet #2 and wallet #3 get their money back in
slot #20:

And what happens on the blockchain? In the case of the successful campaign,
the graph of transactions looks like this:

Finally, the campaign that missed its funding target looks like this:

This concludes this chapter on how to write parameterized contracts to implement
a quite realistic crowdsourcing campaign. We hope you found this informative and useful.
