= Welcome to Plutus - A New Language for Reliable Smart Contracts

== Why Plutus?

The secret behind our approach to high assurance software in general, and in
particular, smart contracts, is functional programming
with advanced type systems.
Plutus is a functional development and execution platform for distributed
contract applications on the Cardano settlement and computational layers. It
provides a platform on which you can develop and deploy your applications and
has been designed with three major audiences in mind: developers, business
experts, and academia. Plutus is embedded in Haskell, is familiar to Haskell
programmers, while being easier to analyze than Haskell itself.

By using Plutus you can be confident in the correct execution of your smart
contracts. It draws from modern language research to provide a safe, full-stack
programming environment based on Haskell, the leading purely functional
programming language. Plutus provides considerable security advantages. It
delivers an easier, more robust way to show that your smart contracts are
correct and will not encounter the problems found in previous smart contract
language design.

Plutus enables a novel integrated approach to smart contract and distributed
application development that is more convenient and safer than previous
alternatives. Both the on-chain and off-chain code are based on the same
language. The smart contract developer uses a uniform code base, which the
Plutus toolchain then automatically separates into on-chain and off-chain code
and packages for deployment.
‌
Plutus was conceived based on the idea that functional programming languages are
much more suited to secure and verifiable programs than conventional imperative
and object-oriented programming languages.
‌
It has been designed to be clear and concise, and the challenge was that it
would fit onto a napkin. This streamlined code was achieved by the team as you
can see in this image:

An SDK is provided for developers which includes the libraries, APIs, tools, and
documentation needed to get started with Plutus. As part of this SDK, Plutus
Playground is available to use to test your Plutus use cases and code. This is a
lightweight, web-based test environment for exploratory Plutus development. Here
you can easily write and deploy your contracts without the overhead of installing
and maintaining a full development environment and blockchain. Once Plutus is
fully integrated with Cardano, it will be possible to deploy contracts that you
develop in the Plutus Playground to the settlement layer of the Cardano
blockchain itself. Contracts that you develop in the Plutus Playground use the
same programming language and library interfaces as those that are deployed to
the Cardano mainnet.

== About the Plutus Framework
‌
Plutus is comprised of several component parts that work together cohesively.
Plutus Platform is the term used to define the combined software support for
writing smart contracts, including the libraries for writing off-chain code in
Haskell, the libraries for writing on-chain code in Plutus Transaction (Plutus
Tx), and
emulator support for testing smart contracts.
‌
Plutus Core refers to the actual language, a small functional programming
language designed to run as on-chain code. Plutus Tx refers to a subset
of Haskell which is compiled into Plutus Core, and Plutus IR is an intermediate
language that compiles to Plutus Core for use as a target language for compiler
writers.

Plutus Playground (PP for short) is a tool for writing and testing any code used to build
smart contracts and define the endpoints for a wallet to be able to engage
in a contract (for example, pay to a script, obtain a refund, etc.).
The other main piece of code defined inside the PP editor is a function
that generates a script that will be included
in the body of a transaction generated by the wallet in the extended UTxO model.
The execution of the contract, driven by time and other external factors,
as well as users' actions, will be simulated by the Playground tool
according to the definitions in this script. The code written in the Playground
tool does not interact with data on the blockchain or in any wallet. Instead,
it uses the simulated versions of these, called the mockchain and the mock wallet.

Note that this book is intended be updated in lockstep with the most current
web version of PP. We will discuss certain features in the most current source
code version when there are significant, relevant or noteworthy differences
between the two versions.

== Running Plutus Playground

The simplest way to use Plutus Playground is to use the {playgrounds}[stable version].

To use the version we discuss in this book and will keep the contents
of the book in sync with, see the {alpha-playgrounds}[alpha version].

At this address the reader will see a window for developing Plutus Tx code.
The code within the window is a single Haskell module which the user may edit.
There are two other tabs, `Simulation` and `Transactions`,
both of which are used for testing the code written in the editor.

There are also several demos listed underneath the tabs, the code of which one
may load into the editor:
the Crowdfunding, Game, Messages, and
Vesting examples. We will discuss these in the corresponding example chapters.
There is also a link to the Plutus tutorial, which shares a lot of content
with the chapters of this book.

For advanced usage instructions, including setting up a local Docker image of the
Plutus Playground, or using the Haskell libraries locally, see the {repo}[Plutus repository README].
