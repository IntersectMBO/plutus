[#03-UTXO]
= UTXO Style Accounting

In order to become proficient with all things Plutus, it is
inevitable that you must first acquire a solid understanding of how
accounting is done on the Cardano platform.

We traditionally think of money transfers as being between two bank accounts,
or perhaps internet addresses in the case of digital currency. The Cardano platform,
like a number of other cryptocurrency platforms such as Bitcoin, uses instead
an accounting approach known as UTXO-style. A full formal description of
this type of accounting can be found as part of the Cardano ledger
formal specification, see <<endmatter#deleg>>.

UTXO-style accounting documents the flow of money not from account to account,
but rather from transaction to transaction. Each transaction has inputs
(where the money being spent is coming from), and outputs
(where this money is going). Note that the body of a transaction may also
contain other data, as we will see later when we examine the extended
UTXO model in the <<09-extended#09-extended>> chapter.

Consider the data flow graph below, <<tx-flow>>. The black lines represent unspent outputs
of transactions, and the red lines represent these outputs being used as inputs
to subsequent transactions. The vertical unlabelled box represents a single
transaction having several inputs and several outputs. The blue certificates
denote remaining unspent outputs in our illustration.
Note that here, at the start of the data flow graph, Alice has 100 Ada in
unspent outputs from before the start time of this graph -
this money comes from one or more transactions outside the scope of this picture.
We abstract this with a single box (labelled with her name and the 100 Ada).
This box has two black (output) lines coming out of it, with the total value
of these outputs adding up to 100 Ada):

* a 58 Ada output from earlier remains unspent by Alice and is part of her
final unspent outputs
* a 42 Ada unspent output of Alice's becomes part of the new transaction

Now, Bob has 10 Ada from previous unspent outputs. He spends them as follows:

* all 10 Ada goes to the new transaction

This new transaction we illustrate here has two inputs, 42 from Alice, and 10
from Bob. This transaction has two outputs, 2 Ada to Bob, and 50 to Charlie.
We also see that Charlie has 52 Ada from a previously unspent output, for
a total of 102 Ada he can spend in future transactions. Bob is left with
only one output of 2 Ada, and Alice, a total of 58 Ada in unspent outputs
from other transactions.

The above model is strictly showing the flow of currency between several
participants. In this simplified version, the transactions illustrated are not
paying fees, etc.
Even in this somewhat simplified model, we see that an output must always be spent
in full. That is, a record of an unspent output cannot be modified (this would
be account-based bookkeeping), only used entirely. In order to maintain
the ledger bookkeeping integrity, the new transaction must have all the unspent outputs (totaling
the correct amount of all the unspent outputs) that are being used up by it. In the
example above, our new transaction removes (i.e. uses as inputs) unspent outputs of value
42 from Alice and 10 from Bob, for a total of 52 Ada. We must then have
52 Ada of outputs from this transaction (2 to Bob and 50 to Charlie).
Note here that Bob had both an unspent output used by this transaction and
an unspent output produced by this transaction. That is, he got, so to say,
change (of 2 Ada) from this transaction. Since there is no true way to spend
part of an output, this is how UTXO accounting deals with partial spending -
by adding a "change" output.

Notice here that this style of accounting makes it convenient, if not intuitive,
to distribute the flow of cash from several contributors to several recipients by
having it flow into a common pot, i.e. the transaction, before being sent to
the intended payees.
This is, in a very general sense, the goal of smart contracts.
Let us explore what is going on during the processing of a UTXO transaction event more formally.
For the basic transaction
model we discuss here, refer to <<utxo-definitions>>.

[#utxo-definitions]
.Basic UTXO definitions

Before we examine the structure of transactions, let us look at how book keeping
is done on the ledger. The record on the ledger that
contains this information is called a UTXO, short of Unspent Transaction Outputs
and denoted `UTXO` in the figure.
This record is a finite map, where the key is a pair of transaction ID and
an index, `TxIn = TxId * Ix`. The transaction ID `TxId`
 can be calculated from a complete transaction
submitted for processing, and is a unique identifier of this transaction.
The index `Ix` is necessary because there may be more than one output,
and each must have a unique identifier within the set of outputs
of a given transaction.
The values in the UTXO finite map are pairs of a coin value and an
address, whose type is `TxOut = Addr * Coin`.
Note that users' addresses are always public keys, and the funds at them
belong to the entity who is able to prove that they possess the corresponding
private key. Script (or smart contract) addresses are slightly different, as we will see later.

As for the structure of the transaction itself,
let us examine the outputs first. A single transaction may distribute
the money it is spending to several different addresses.
The outputs (values of type `TxOut`) are stored in a transaction as the values in a finite map.
The keys of the finite map are distinct index values within the context
of the finite map, such that the
combination of a transaction ID and an index will be a globally unique
identifier for the output of a transaction.
In the UTXO accounting scheme, we relate
output values to the inputs from which they come by means of this composite
global identifier.

The inputs, whose order does not matter, are a set and not a list.
The elements of this set contain neither
a coin value to be spent, nor the address which the money is coming from.
This is the main distinction between traditional accounting and UTXO accounting:
the money being spent is only referred to by the unspent outputs of
previously processed transactions on the ledger that reside currently on the blockchain.
Each element of the input sets is a pair of a transaction ID and an index,
which, as explained above, uniquely identifies the unspent output in the UTXO
that is to be spent.

Processing a transaction involves updating the UTXO on the ledger in a way
that makes the funds spent by the transaction being processed available to
be spent by the owners of the addresses listed in the outputs. That is,
all the entries corresponding to the inputs of the processed transaction are
removed from the ledger UTXO.

Additionally, all the `TxOut` values in
the finite map of the outputs of the transaction are added to the UTXO,
with the key of the finite map consisting of the ID of the transaction being processed,
and the index value the same as in the the finite map of outputs of this transaction.
That is, if `tx` contains a pair of a set of inputs and a finite map
of outputs `(ins, outs)` with ID `id`, and
`ix |-> (a,c)` is an entry in `outs`, the UTXO will
have the entry `(id, ix) |-> (a,c)` added. Here, we use the notation `k |-> v`
to refer to an entry in a finite map which has the key `k` and the value `v`.

Now, we would like to capture this update concisely in terms of mathematical
notation (which is rather human-readable), but can be translated directly into
code. We will adhere to the use of this notation in our explanation of
the inclusion of Plutus Tx scrips inside transactions as well. The following
definitions are three ways to filter a UTXO finite map. The first one is
filtering the UTXO by a subset `ins` of the keys. The second filter
gives the compliment of the result of the first filter (i.e. all the UTXO
entries not indexed by keys in the list of inputs). The third filter
filters UTXO entries by the values.

We would like to use this notation to process a new transaction. That is,
remove the spent outputs, and build the
set of new outputs a transaction is adding to the UTXO (as we described above).
We may compute the outputs as follows:

image::outputs.png[]

Using this notation, we can define the UTXO update due to a transaction
`tx` as follows:

image::utxoupd.png[]

Note that an explicit calculation of the total amount of Ada in the outputs and
the total Ada in all the inputs of a transaction must be performed as part of
validating a transaction. There are destinations for the Ada being spent in the inputs
besides being added as UTXO entries. The main one is the treasury, which is kept
track of as a value on the ledger. Transaction fees and
deposits are paid into the treasury, for example. There could also be output entries
in a transaction without
corresponding inputs - these are due to collecting rewards from reward
addresses.

Now, in order to validate a transaction, there are a number of
calculations performed involving the Ada in the transaction and the Ada
in other accounts on the ledger to make sure Ada is neither created nor destroyed,
so to say. This is known as the _generalized accounting property_.
The UTXO accounting scheme provides built-in protection against double spending
of a given output.
This inherent protection, together with the enforcement of the generalized
accounting property,
ensures that no dishonest spending is allowed to occur. This is a crucial property
of the Cardano ledger bookkeeping system, in particular because there is a
set amount of Ada in existence, which can never change.

Note also that a transaction includes a host of other data, such as
witnesses, certificates, and scripts along with their hashes.
Here we have not gone into the details of the specific types and calculations
used in the Cardano ledger implementation, but you should now have a
sufficient understanding of the structure of a transaction and how it is
processed to be able to understand what goes on behind the
scenes when Plutus code is used to generate a transaction.
