= A Complex Example: Secure Non-Fungible Tokens

In this chapter, we want
to demonstrate the evolution of a complex and secure system.
We will develop our solution in several steps, each more secure than the
previous one.
Along the way we will learn some new and interesting design techniques
and dive deeper into the custom-token system introduced in the <<token#token,last chapter>>.

Imagine that we just had a brilliant idea: We want to tokenize works of art by
linking them to unique, _<<endmatter#non-fungible-token,non-fungible tokens>>_ on the blockchain. Each of these
tokens will be linked to one particular work of art, so it will be easy to trade
ownership of, say, a painting, by simply trading the corresponding token.

This book is about Plutus, not international law, so let us assume that our
lawyers have solved all legal issues with this idea and that we also have
solved the problem of actually _linking_ a real-world work of art with a token
on the blockchain (maybe by entering into a partnership with a renowned arts dealer
who publicly certifies that ownership of painting so-and-so is determined by
token so-and-so).

Let us instead concentrate on the _technical_ challenge of making the
smart-contract side of things as bullet proof as possible!

Where in the <<token#token,last chapter>>
we used one <<endmatter#currency-symbol>> and one <<endmatter#token-name>>
for our custom currency, we now need one token name per token, i.e. one token
name per work of art we want to tokenize.

Let us start by creating a _monetary policy_ that allows only us to forge new
tokens:

include::nonfungible1.adoc[]

We can test this in the <<endmatter#plutus-playground>> and forge tokens
for Da Vinci's _Mona Lisa_ and for Van Gogh's _The Starry Night_ (yes, we are very
optimistic that the Louvre and the Museum of Modern Art will be eager to join
forces with us...).

It works! We are now the proud owners of the _Mona Lisa_ token and the
_The Starry Night_ token.

Are we done? Can we deploy these scripts and be in business?

We made sure that our monetary policy guarantees that only _we_ can forge
tokens, so what else could possibly go wrong?

We should remember that scipts only validate using script outputs as _input_,
but that anybody can create transactions with arbitrary script _outputs_.
In our case this means that some prankster (or business rival) can throw a
spanner in the works by creating another output at our monetary policy:

include::nonfungible2.adoc[]

We can try the effect of `prank` in the Playground and have Wallet #2 invoke it
after we forge the _Mona Lisa_ token:

image:non-fungible-actions2.png[]

The prank works, and forging the _The Starry Night_ token fails.

image:non-fungible-result2.png[]

To make matters worse, we get a misleading error message:

image:non-fungible-result3.png[]

So what to do about this? Actually, there is a one line fix
once we realize that in order to forge, we do not really care
whether we use a script output created by ourselves or by somebody else.
Any will do:

include::nonfungible3.adoc[]

When we test in the Playground with the same actions as before,
we get back our _The Starry Night_ token:

image:non-fungible-result4.png[]

image:non-fungible-result5.png[]

Alas, now the _prankster_ can up his game and make the following one-line change to `prank`:

include::nonfungible4.adoc[]

This time, he has to work harder to sabotage us, has to invoke `prank` several
times:

image:non-fungible-actions3.png[]

image:non-fungible-result6.png[]

image:non-fungible-result7.png[]

Note that we also get a different error message this time, not our custom wallet
error, but a "script error".

So what is going on?

What we have to realize is that <<endmatter#script-output,script _outputs_>> of
a transaction are not validated, only <<endmatter#script-input,script _inputs_>>
are. This means that the data script of a script output is not checked; in
particular, it can be of an arbitrary type (like `Integer` in our example).

What happens when we pick such an output with "wrong" type as input for our
forging transaction? That input _will_ be validated, and our validator assumes
the data script to be of type `()`. So it will simply fail without executing any
of our validation code when the type is not the expected one.

Why does the prankster have to call `prank` several times in this attack? - For
forging, we pick the first script output we find. If we are lucky, we pick the
one we created ourselves, which has a data script with the correct type. The
order in which we "see" the results of `outputsAt` is an implementation detail
which depends on the hash of the transaction that created the output. By calling
`prank` several times, the prankster increases the probability that one of _his_
outputs will be the first one our wallet sees, which in turn will lead to a
failure of `forge` during validation.

How can we defend ourselves against this devious and subtle attack? - It is
actually quite simple: Instead of picking the first script output we find, we
simply _filter_ the outputs and check their data scripts:

include::nonfungible5.adoc[]

Trying the same actions in the Playground again,
_The Starry Night_ is back:

image:non-fungible-result8.png[]

To summarize what we have achieved so far: Our monetary policy script guarantees
that nobody but us can forge new tokens. However, in order for us to create a
forging transaction, we need an output at the address of that monetary policy.
We can not assume that there is only one such output, because other people can
create arbitrary outputs at that address themselves if they like. This would not
be a problem if it were not for the fact that those other outputs can have the
wrong data script type, which makes our validator script fail when we use one of
those faulty outputs. By preparing for the fact that there can be several
outputs and by filtering out outputs with the wrong type of data scripts, we can
ensure that we always will find an output that works. We will therefore always
be able to forge new tokens when we like.

As far as we ourselves are concerned, we are safe now. With the latest iteration
of the code, we have made sure that we can forge new tokens whenever we like, no
matter what other people do, and we have written the validator script in a way
to ensure that nobody else can create new tokens.

Unfortunately, there is another problem: Our business idea hinges on the fact
that there is a _unique_ token for each work of art we handle. If somebody buys
the _Mona Lisa_ token from us, he would be highly upset if we sold _another_
_Monad Lisa_ token to somebody else. We would never do a thing like that, of
course, but still - would it not be nice if
we could make the system _guarantee_ that there will always ever be at most
one token of a given name? After all, one of the reasons for using a blockchain
in the first place is the idea of replacing _trust_ with _science_ and
_cryptographic proofs_. Smart contracts have been invented to mechanically
enforce just such types of properties, allowing everybody to check the code for
themselves and not being forced to trust anybody.

So how can we adjust the contract to force ourselves to be honest? We need some
way of tracking which tokens have already been forged. Such _contract state_ intuitively
belongs into the <<endmatter#data-script>>, but the present version of Plutus
makes it somewhat difficult to _inspect_ data scripts (except the one belonging
to the <<endmatter#script-input>> that the <<endmatter#validator-script>> is
inspecting). This will change in the next version of Plutus.

For our case, it will be easier to use _value_ to track already forged tokens:
The idea is that instead of forging one token, we forge _three_, but "trap" two
of those in the script output, which will then be the script input for the
next forging transaction, so by inspecting that input's value, we can see which
tokens have already been forged. Why three and not two? Other people will only
be able to get their hands on _one_ token with a given name,
so when we see a script output containing two tokens of the same name, we know
it has be _us_ who created that output.

include::nonfungible6.adoc[]

We can try it in the Playground and see what happens when we try to forge the
_Monad Lisa_ token a second time:

image:non-fungible-actions4.png[]

image:non-fungible-result9.png[]

image:non-fungible-result10.png[]

As expected, the second forging of the _Mona Lisa_ token fails, and we only get
one _Mona Lisa_ token and one _The Starry Night_ token.

With this version of the contract, we are prevented to forging the same token
twice _by mistake_ (and we can still be sure that nobody else can sabotage us).
As long as we use the wallet endpoints in their present form, there will never
be two _Mona Lisa_ tokens.

Unfortunately, this will not convince sceptics that it is _impossible_ to forge
the same token twice. Indeed, we can do so by changing the `forge` enpoint as
follows:

include::nonfungible7.adoc[]

If we now invoke `start` a second time after forging two tokens, we will create
a new script output with _zero value_, and this output will be picked as input
for the next forging (due to the changed logic of `findOut`). We end up with
_two_ _Mona Lisa_ tokens, exactly as our critics claimed we could if we wanted
to.

image:non-fungible-actions5.png[]

image:non-fungible-result11.png[]

So how can we make the contract so airtight that no matter what we do in our
wallet, everybody knows with absolute certainty that there will never be more
than one instance of the same token?

The idea is to create an _admin token_ that can only exist once. Once we have
that, we can require this admin token to be present in the script input
representing our monetary policy. Because the admin token only exists once,
there can only be at most one suitable such script input, so we can no longer
cheat by having two different script inputs.

We can also stop forging _three_ new tokens each time and instead forge _two_,
because as long as we make sure the admin token stays at the script address, we
can always identify the right script output by looking for the presence of the
admin token.

At first glance, this idea looks like circular logic: We want to solve the
problem of preventing forging of more than one token with the same name by using
an admin token that only exists once. Sounds like in order to solve our original
problem, we now face exactly the same problem with the admin token: How do we
ensure it can only exist once?

Luckily, there is a solution for this. Remember that
<<endmatter#transaction-output,transaction outputs>> are unique (as mentioned above, this is
strictly speaking not true in the Playground in the absence of fees, but it _is_
true for outputs of transactions that spend some ada).

We will create our admin token as follows: We pick a unique transaction output
that we own. In the monetary policy of the _admin token_, we ensure that a new
admin token can only be forged in a transaction that spends this output. By
spending it, the output is "destroyed", so we can never have a second such
transaction, and the admin token is indeed unique.

Let us look at the code for this:

include::nonfungible8.adoc[]

Finally we have reached our goal: By systematically closing loophole after
loophole, we now have a contract that is reliable and secure. Nobody can
interfere with us, and everybody can be certain that no matter what we do, there
will never be two tokens with the same name.

All that remains is convincing the Louvre to work with us...
