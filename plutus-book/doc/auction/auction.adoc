= State Machines - Building an Auction System

While waiting for our negotiations with the Louvre to come to a satisfactory
conclusion, we run short of funds. We consider selling one of the other
tokens in our possession, the _Guernica_ token.
In the <<token#token,chapter on custom tokens>>
we covered how to securely sell a token,
but we think that we might get a better price
if we run an _auction_ instead. So let us build an auction system!

We want to implement a simple _English auction_ with a fixed deadline: After the
uction has started, people can make _bids_. Once the deadline has been
reached, the token owner receives the highest bid, and the highest bidder gets the
token.

Of course we want to enforce all auction rules automatically with Plutus.
We want to make sure that each bid is guaranteed (so that the highest bidder will
have to pay, and that the owner of the token will have to transfer ownership of
the token to the highest bidder once the auction has ended.

The auction will _start_ when the token owner sends the token to the auction
contract. Bidders can then _bid_ by sending ada to the same contract. If a bidder is
outbid by a higher bid, she can _reclaim_ her previous bid(s). When the auction
ends, the token owner canremove the highest bid from the contract, so that finally the
highest bidder can take the token.

One problem we discussed in the last chapter was the problem of how to deal with
several outputs to a contract. We want to keep the state in one output, but
nobody can prevent others from arbitrarilycreating many more outputs.

We solved the problem by creating a unique "admin token" and using its
uniqueness to identify the "right" contract output.

For our auction, we are in the fortunate situation that the token we want to
auction is unique by assumption. We can therefore always identify the "right"
output as the one containing this token, as long as we make sure that the token
remains locked in the contract until the very end.

This is the reason why the last action in a successful auction will be the
highest bidder taking the token out of the contract.

Can there be unsuccessful auctions? Well, yes there can, as nobody can force anybody to place
a bid, so if the deadline arrives without any bids having been made, the token
owner must be able to _reclaim_ his token from the contract.

In both cases, the auction starts when potential bidders start watching the
contract address and when the token owner locks the token into the
contract, and it ends when the highest bidder or the token owner takes the token
back out of the contract again.

We therefore need the following wallet endpoints:

* `watchAuction` for bidders to start watching the auction contract, which is
  necessary for them to be able to find the right output,
* `startAuction` for the token owner to start the auction,
* `bid` for bidders to place bids,
* `reclaimBid` for bidders who have been outbid to reclaim their bids,
* `claimBid` for the token owner to claim the highest bid after the auction has
  ended,
* `claimToken` for the highest bidder to claim the token in the end 
* `reclaimToken` for the token owner to reclaim the token if the auction ends
  without any bid having been placed.

We start with a type `EnglishAuction` to define an auction:

The transaction graph for a simple example looks as follows:

Alice is the token owner and runs the auction. Bob bids 1000 ada, then gets outbid by Charlie, who bids 1100 ada. Bob reclaims his 1000 ada,
then Alice claims the highest bid of 1100 ada, and finally Charlie claims the token.

Finally, we want to test our auction system in the Plutus Playground. We start by adding a third wallet and giving each wallet an initial balance
of 20.

The next steps are a bit tricky, because we need the currency symbol of the admin token to forge
our non-fungible token, and we need the currency symbol of _that_ token to start the auction.

We thus need two preliminary steps: First only run endpoint `start` and check the logs for the admin token symbol.
Then run endpoint `forge` to forge the Guernica token 
(using the correct admin token symbol from the first step) and look into the logs again to find the Guernica symbol.

Finally, we use endpoints `autoBid` for the bidders (wallets #2 and #3) and `runAuction` for the seller (wallet #1). 
We also need to add a sufficiently long wait-action of for example 20 slots at the end (not shown in the screenshot).
In our example, we use a minimal bid of 2, an increment of 1, and we set wallet #2's maximum bid to 6 and wallet #3's maximum bid to 4.

As expected, wallet #2 wins the auction with a highest bid of 5 and gets the Guernica token:
