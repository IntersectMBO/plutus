[#multi]
= Multi-Stage Contracts

The example scripts we have seen so far had one thing in common: all locked funds
were collected from them in one step. In this chapter, we want to look at an
example where this is not the case and where the funds can be collected in
potentially many steps.

Our example will be a _vesting scheme_:
in such a scheme, parts (so called _tranches_) of the locked funds become available
at certain times. To simplify matters, we will look at vesting schemes with
_two_ such tranches.

For example, there might be one tranche with an amount of 4 Ada and an
availability date of slot #10 and another tranche with an amount of 6 Ada
available in slot #20. So a total of 10 Ada is locked in the scheme, and in
the beginning, none of those Ada are available. Starting in slot #10, the first 4
Ada can be collected, and starting in slot #20, the rest is available.

Note that the _owner_ of the scheme, the person allowed to collect the funds,
can do so in as many steps as she likes. So in our example from above,
she might collect 2 Ada in slot #10, another 2 Ada in slot #11, then 5 Ada in slot
#20 and the final 1 Ada in slot #21.

While implementing this example, we will have to construct a transaction with
one or more inputs and two outputs, so we will not be able to use convenient
helper functions like like `payToScript_` or `collectFromScript`
as we did before.

.Building complex transactions
[NOTE]
====
We can build an arbitrarily complex transaction using:

[source,haskell]
----
createTxAndSubmit :: MonadWallet m => SlotRange -> Set TxIn -> [TxOut] -> m Tx
----

In order to apply this function, we need to construct transaction inputs and
transaction outputs, and we can use the following functions for this purpose:

[source,haskell]
----
pubKeyTxIn  :: TxOutRef -> PubKey -> TxIn
scriptTxIn  :: TxOutRef -> Validator -> RedeemerValue -> TxIn

pubKeyTxOut :: Value -> PubKey -> TxOut
scriptTxOut :: Value -> Validator -> DataValue -> TxOut
----

Finally, to get our hands on the necessary ``TxOutRef``'s,
we can use:

[source,haskell]
----
outputsAt :: MonadWallet m => Address -> m (Map TxOutRef TxOut)
----

Note that `outputsAt` will only return those outputs which are _known
to the wallet_, i.e. those residing at an address that is either _watched_
or for which a trigger has been registered.

Let us start by defining types for tranches and vesting schemes!

Let us try the example from the beginning of this chapter in the Playground!

We leave it as an exercise for the reader to check that validation will fail if
wallet #2 tries to withdraw too much money too early.

Let us visualize what happens on the blockchain when all goes well! In the first
transaction Alice, owner of wallet #1, registers the scheme. In the following
transactions Bob, owner of wallet #2, withdraws the funds in accordance with the
vesting scheme:

In this chapter, we have seen how to write multi-stage contracts, contracts
which go through several stages before finally all money has been collected.
We have also seen how to construct complicated transactions with several inputs
and outputs "by hand".
