= Our First On-Chain Code

Now that we are somewhat comfortable with the Wallet API and know how to write
off-chain code, let us look at a first example of _on-chain_ code,
a simple guessing game.

The idea of the game is that one player can think of a secret word
and then donate some Ada as reward for anybody who correctly guesses the secret.

As always when writing Haskell code, we should start by thinking about _types_.
In particular, we have to figure out the types wrapped in the _data scripts_
and _redeemer scripts_.

The redeemer script will unlock the reward in case of a successful guess,
so it must contain that guess.

For the _validator script_ to be able to do its job and validate a guess,
it needs to be able to decide whether the guess is correct.
An obvious choice for the data script would therefore be the secret word,
but seeing as the data script is visible for all on the public ledger,
this would make it trivial for players to guess correctly.
Instead of using the secret word directly, we therefore use its _hash_
for the data script, making it impossible (or at least very hard) to
reconstruct the secret from looking at the data script on the ledger.

Words and their hashes can both be represented by a `ByteString`,
one of the primitive types available to Plutus Core,
but as in "normal" Haskell, it will be better to create distinct types
for those two, so that there will be no danger of confusing them.

Once defined, those types can be made available on-chain by using the
Template Haskell function `makeLift`, which will create `Lift` instances
and therefore enable us to use the crucial

[source,haskell]
----
lifted :: Lift a => a -> Script
----

to convert plain old values into Plutus scripts.

So let's get started!

We can test this in the Playground: If wallet #1 wants to think of the secret
word and wallets #2 and #3 want to try and guess it, our simulation might
contain the following actions:

- Wallet #2 starts.
- Wallet #3 starts.
- Wallet #1 challenges the others with the secret word _Haskell_ and a reward of
  5 Ada.
- Wallet #2 incorrectly guesses _Scala_.
- Wallet #3 guesses correctly.

As a result, wallet #3 would end up with the reward.

What will happen on the blockchain when these actions are performed?

When wallet #1 executes `lock`, a transaction `tx 1` will be submitted to the
blockchain, successfully be validated (provided Wallet #1 owns at least 5 Ada)
and incorporated into a block. As input, the transaction will have one or more
UTxO's belonging to Wallet #1 with total value at least 5 Ada. As output,
the transaction will have one UTxO at the game script address with value 5 Ada
and data script containing the hash of "Haskell". There might also be another output
for the change.

Then wallet #2 submits a transaction `tx 2` with input the newly created script
output and output its own public key. However, because the wrong redeemer
"Scala" is used, this transaction will fail to validate.

Finally wallet #3 submits a transaction `tx 3` with input the script output and
outputs its own public key, and this transaction will be successfully validated,
because it uses the correct redeemer "Haskell":

This concludes our first example of a Plutus smart contract combining on-chain
with off-chain code. We have seen how to lift types and values to Plutus Core,
how to write a validator script and how to interact with a script address in the
wallet.
