= The Plutus eBook: Writing Reliable Smart Contracts in Plutus

Welcome to the Plutus eBook project. This ebook is written using https://asciidoctor.org/[asciidoctor],
we encourage you to consult its excellent documentation for more details.

The book content is in the `doc` directory, and Literate Haskell sources
are in the `src` directory.

== Building the book

=== Using `nix`

The book can be built in all its formats using `nix` (which is 
what the CI uses).

* Run `nix build -f default.nix docs.plutus-book` in the root of
  the repository.
** Make sure you've followed <<../README.adoc#iohk-binary-cache,How to set up the IOHK binary caches>>.
* Look inside the `result` directory.

=== Using `asciidoctor` directly

This will just get you the html output, which is probably what
you want during development.

* Ensure you have the following installed:
** `asciidoctor`
** `python`
* Run `asciidoctor plutus.adoc`.
* Open the resulting `plutus.html` in a browser.

== Building the Literate Haskell

The Literate Haskell can be built with `nix`.

* Run `nix build -f default.nix localPackages.plutus-book` in the root of
  the repository.
** Make sure you've followed <<../README.adoc#iohk-binary-cache,How to set up the IOHK binary caches>>.
** You can also use `cabal` or `stack`, see the 
   <<../README.adoc#_Plutus_Platform,main README>>
   for more about building Haskell packages.

== Book structure

The entry point to the book is `plutus.adoc`. This defines the main document
attributes and includes all the chapters in sequence.

Chapters should be written in separate files (beginning the files with their
sequence number is not essential but helpful), and included into `plutus.adoc`.

To use Literate Haskell:

* Write Haskell in asciidoc source blocks.
* Symlink the file into the `src` directory as a `.lhs` file.
* Add the module to `plutus-book.cabal`.

== Miscellaneous

Unfortunately due to a quirk of how `asciidoctor` parses double colons, it's
tricky to write Haskell type signatures in the main text without them
rendering wrong. To get around that, use an attribute reference `{2c}` 
instead of the colons.
