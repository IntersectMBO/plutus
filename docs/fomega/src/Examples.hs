{- We may think of a system of fixed point equations (corresponding to some mutually recursive types)

t1 = T1(t1,...,tn)
...
tn = Tn(t1,...,tn)

in terms of a "density matrix"

t1,1 t1,2 ... t1,n
t2,1 t2,2 ... t2,n
...
tn,1 tn,2 ... tn,n

where ti,j \in Nat is the number of times tj appears in Ti(t1,...,tn).

We can generate a system of mutually recursive types with any given density matrix.

Useful for testing!
