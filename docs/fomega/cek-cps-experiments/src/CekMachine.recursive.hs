-- This file contains a version of the CEK machine in
-- implemented as a simple recursie evaluator, with
-- a lot of !s inserted to (hopefully) make sure that
-- we're evaluating the code eagerly.  This can also
-- be regarded as the CPS version with continuations
-- converted back into ordinary function calls.


-- | The CEK machine.
-- Rules are the same as for the CK machine from "Language.PlutusCore.Evaluation.CkMachine",
-- except we do not use substitution and use environments instead.
-- The CEK machine relies on variables having non-equal 'Unique's whenever they have non-equal
-- string names. I.e. 'Unique's are used instead of string names, so the renamer pass is required.
-- This is for efficiency reasons.
-- The type checker pass is required as well (and in our case it subsumes the renamer pass).
-- Feeding ill-typed terms to the CEK machine will likely result in a 'MachineException'.
-- The CEK machine generates booleans along the way which might contain globally non-unique 'Unique's.
-- This is not a problem as the CEK machines handles name capture by design.
