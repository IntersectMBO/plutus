To run the tests, type `run-all`.  This will build and
run the tests, saving the results in the current directory.

To plot the graphs, type `R --no-save < r/draw-all.r` assuming you
have R installed); this will read the files produced by the `run-all`
script and produce PDFs containing graphs.  These can be included in
tex documents (as in `results.tex`).
