# Ethereum Smart Contracts in the Wild

This document looks at Ethereum smart contracts which were actually
running on the Ethereum blockchain in August 2019.

## Resources
There are a number of websites and articles which were helpful.

Firstly, http://etherscan.io lets you examine the Ethereum blockchain
in detail, including details of smart contracts ("Etherscan is the
leading Ethereum Blockchain Explorer. The core of Etherscan involves
extracting data from the Ethereum distributed ledger, indexing and
displaying the processed data in a concise and readable manner for the
masses and layperson."  ).

Users can upload smart contract source code to the website and
Etherscan will certify that they compile to particular bytecode
contracts, allowing you to examine the source code of at least some
contracts which you may find on the chain.

If you know the address of a smart contract then you can paste it into
the search bar at the top of the page and etherscan will give you lots
of information.

For example, the CryptoKitties contract has address 0x06012c8cf97bead5deae237070f9587f8e7a266d
and you can see information about it at https://etherscan.io/address/0x06012c8cf97bead5deae237070f9587f8e7a266d

![1](./CryptoKittiesInfo.png)

Note the link "Contract" near the centre of the image.  In this case it
has a green tick attached which means that the Solidity source of the contract is available,
and clicking on the link will show it to you:

You can also go to https://etherscan.io/contractsVerified to see the last 500 contracts verified by Etherscan.

Etherscan also has a blog at https://medium.com/etherscan-blog/ which has some interesting articles.

----------------------------

There's an article talking about the usage of Ethereum smart contracts at
https://medium.com/@vikati/ranking-ethereum-smart-contracts-a27e6f622ac6

This contains links to pages showing the top 50 contracts by
[transactions](https://blockspur.com/ethereum_contracts/transactions),
["uniques"](https://blockspur.com/ethereum_contracts/uniques),
and [revenues](https://blockspur.com/ethereum_contracts/values).
Statistics are available for the most recent calendar month.

Unfortunately these pages are slightly broken:  the addresses of the
contracts are clickable and look as if they should show you more information
on the contract, but this doesn't work.  Instead I had to copy the URLs,
extract the contract addresses, and paste them into Etherscan to find out about the contracts.

There's a more detailed look at the most popular contracts for August 2019 [later](#popular-contracts-in-august-2019).

-----------------------

There's some more analysis of popularity of Ethereum contracts 
[here](https://blog.sfox.com/what-29-985-328-transactions-say-about-the-state-of-smart-contracts-on-ethereum-2ebdba4bea1c).

... and a site which tells you which contracts are currently using the most gas at https://ethgasstation.info/gasguzzlers.php.

Also, Google has large public databases of both
[Ethereum](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/ethereum-bigquery-public-dataset-smart-contract-analytics
) and [Bitcoin](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/bitcoin-in-bigquery-blockchain-analytics-on-public-data
) transactions which you can query yourself (although it might take some time to construct appropriate queries).

### Some Ethereum background

There are two Ethereum standards which are important for smart
contracts: [ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) and
[ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721).  ERC-20 allows the
implementation of user-defined _token currencies_ on the Ethereum
chain and ERC-721 introduces non-fungible tokens which can be used to
represent ownership of some digital or physical asset.  To use either
of these you implement a smart contract which conforms to a specified
API which acts as the monetary policy.  For example in the case of
ERC-20 you implement a contract with functions which return the total
supply or the number of tokens owned by a specified individual, or
allow a user to transfer funds to another user, and so on.

Users may wish to trade one ERC-20 for another, and this can be done
using a _decentralised exchange_ (or _DEX_): these are generally
implemented as smart contracts.
