\title{Typechecking Costs in the Plutus Core Library}
\author{Vanessa McHale}
\maketitle

\section{Costs \& Modes}

The Plutus Core library typechecker has two modes; a restricted mode in which
reductions are limited based on the size of the term, and an unrestricted mode
for prototyping in which type reductions are unlimited and unchecked.

\section{Complexity}

For security purposes, the cost of typechecking in restricted mode must
be linear in the program size.
