# This workflows moves issues and pull requests to the next sprint iteration of 
# the Plutus Backlog project. In practice, all open backlog items in the Current
# Iteration (the one that is still in progress) will be moved to the Next 
# Iteration (the one that will start next).
# This workflow must be run manually from the GitHub Actions page.
# In practice you want to run this on the last day of the current sprint, the 
# day before the next sprint begins.
