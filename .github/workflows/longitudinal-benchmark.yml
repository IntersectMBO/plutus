# This workflow runs a suite of benchmarks and detects performance regressions.
# The benchmark charts are live at https://plutus.cardano.intersectmbo.org/dev/bench
# The benchmark data is available at https://plutus.cardano.intersectmbo.org/dev/bench/data.js
#
# This workflow runs on push to master, and on pull requests to the release/* branches,
# and it can also be triggered manually.
