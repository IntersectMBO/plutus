# This workflow runs the benchmarks defined in the environment variable BENCHMARKS.
# It will collect and aggreate the benchmark output, format it and feed it to the
# github-action-benchmark action.
#
# The benchmark charts are live at https://plutus.cardano.intersectmbo.org/dev/bench
# The benchmark data is available at https://plutus.cardano.intersectmbo.org/dev/bench/data.js

# This is a performance regression check that is run on every push master.
