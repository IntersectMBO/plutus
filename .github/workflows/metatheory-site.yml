      ref:
        description: |
          The $ref to build off of, e.g. "1.29.0.0", "master", or any other valid git ref.
          When making a release, this is usually the version tag, e.g. "1.29.0.0", and will be
          equal to the $destination input below. When back-porting this could be a commit sha instead.
        required: true
        type: string

      destination:
        description: |
          The $destination folder, e.g. when "1.29.0.0" the metatheory will be deploy to:
          https://intersectmbo.github.io/plutus/metatheory/1.29.0.0
        required: true
        type: string
  
      latest: 
        description: |
          If true, then the metatheory site will also be deploy to:
          https://intersectmbo.github.io/plutus/metatheory/latest.
          You want to leave this to true unless you are deploying old versions or back-porting.
