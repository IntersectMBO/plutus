# This job runs `cabal build all` on Linux with all supported GHC versions.
# Normally, if Nix can build the shell and the packages via haskell.nix, we can be confident that 
# Cabal can build the project inside the Nix shell.
# However, this workflow is implemented to catch edge cases, such as the one described in 
# https://github.com/IntersectMBO/plutus/issues/6625.
#
# This job runs on all pull requests and on push to master, and it can also be triggered manually.
