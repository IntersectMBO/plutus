# This workflow builds and deploys the Haddock site.
# 
# When this workflow is triggered manually via workflow dispatch, it builds and then 
# publishes the site according to the 'ref' input:
# https://plutus.cardano.intersectmbo.org/haddock/$ref
# And optionally (if the 'latest' flag is set) to: 
# https://plutus.cardano.intersectmbo.org/haddock/latest
#
# This workflow also builds and publishes the site on push to master to:
# https://plutus.cardano.intersectmbo.org/haddock/master
#
# This workflow does not trigger on each pull request because it takes about 1h to run.
# However it will build (but not deploy) the site on pull requests to the release/* branches.

          The ref to build off of, e.g. "1.29.0.0", "master", or any other valid git ref.
          When making a release, this is usually the version tag, e.g. "1.29.0.0", and will be
          equal to the $destination input below. When back-porting this could be a commit sha instead.

      destination:
        description: |
          The destination folder, e.g. when "1.29.0.0" the haddock site will be deployed to:
          https://plutus.cardano.intersectmbo.org/haddock/1.29.0.0
        required: true

          If true, then the haddock site will also be deployed to:
          https://plutus.cardano.intersectmbo.org/haddock/latest.
          You want to check this when you are making a release.
          You want to uncheck this when you are deploying old versions or back-porting.
