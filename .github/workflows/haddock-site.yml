          The ref to build off of, e.g. "1.29.0.0", "master", or any other valid git ref.
          When making a release, this is usually the version tag, e.g. "1.29.0.0", and will be
          equal to the $destination input below. When back-porting this could be a commit sha instead.
        required: true
        type: string

      destination:
        description: |
          The destination folder, e.g. when "1.29.0.0" the haddock site will be deployed to:
          https://plutus.cardano.intersectmbo.org/haddock/1.29.0.0
        required: true
