# iots-export

A tool to export Haskell types and functions to a format usable in TypeScript,
via [IOTS][iots].

[IOTS][iots] is a library for wokring runtime data in a
TypeScript-compatible way. This library lets you export Haskell types
and functions as IOTS. So, your backend Haskell team can share
structure with the TypeScript frontend team.
