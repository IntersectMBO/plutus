# Formal Specification

## Plutus Core Language Specification

The formal specification of the Plutus Core language provides a comprehensive mathematical foundation for understanding the semantics and behavior of Plutus smart contracts.

ðŸ“„ **[Formal Specification of the Plutus Core Language](https://plutus.cardano.intersectmbo.org/resources/plutus-core-spec.pdf)**

This specification document includes:

- **Syntax and Semantics**: Complete formal definition of the Plutus Core language syntax and operational semantics
- **Type System**: Detailed description of the type system and typing rules
- **Evaluation Rules**: Precise specification of how Plutus Core programs are evaluated
- **Builtin Functions**: Formal treatment of builtin functions and their semantics
- **Cost Model**: Mathematical framework for the cost model used in script execution

The formal specification serves as the authoritative reference for:
- Compiler developers implementing Plutus Core
- Researchers studying the theoretical properties of the language
- Developers seeking deep understanding of script execution mechanics
- Auditors verifying the correctness of smart contract implementations
