# Plutus Core Specification

The formal specification provides a comprehensive mathematical foundation for understanding the semantics and behavior of Plutus smart contracts.

📄 **[Formal Specification of the Plutus Core Language](https://plutus.cardano.intersectmbo.org/resources/plutus-core-spec.pdf)**

This specification is periodically updated to reflect changes and improvements to the language and its cost model.

This specification document includes:

- **Syntax and Semantics**: Complete formal definition of the Plutus Core language syntax and operational semantics
- **Type System**: Detailed description of the type system and typing rules
- **Evaluation Rules**: Precise specification of how Plutus Core programs are evaluated
- **Builtin Functions**: Formal treatment of builtin functions and their semantics
- **Cost Model**: Mathematical framework for the cost model used in script execution

The formal specification serves as the authoritative reference for:
- Compiler developers implementing Plutus Core
- Researchers studying the theoretical properties of the language
- Developers seeking deep understanding of script execution mechanics
- Auditors verifying the correctness of smart contract implementations
