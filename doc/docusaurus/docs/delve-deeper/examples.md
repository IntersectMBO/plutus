# Examples

Full examples of Plutus Applications can be found in the [plutus-apps repository](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/plutus-apps/tree/master/plutus-use-cases).
The source code can be found in the `src` and the tests in the `test` folder.

The examples are a mixture of simple examples and more complex ones, including:

- A crowdfunding application
- A futures application
- A stablecoin
- A uniswap clone

> **Important**
>
> Make sure to look at the same version of the [plutus-apps repository](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/plutus-apps/tree/master/plutus-use-cases) as you are using, to ensure that the examples work.
