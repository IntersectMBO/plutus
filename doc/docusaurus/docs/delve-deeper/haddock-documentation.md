# Haddock Documentation

Haddock is a tool for automatically generating documentation from annotated Haskell source code.
The Haddock for the latest release of public libraries from the [plutus repository](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/plutus) is available [here](https://plutus.cardano.intersectmbo.org/haddock/latest).
You can also use the dropdown menu to view the Haddock for an older release or the master branch.

When writing validators with Plutus Tx, modules in the `plutus-tx` package will be the most relevant.
If you're interested in learning about lower-level languages, check out the `PlutusIR`, `PlutusCore` and `UntypedPlutusCore` modules.
