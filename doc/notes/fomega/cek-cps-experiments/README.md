This directory contains a document about the performance of various
versions of the CEK machine.  The results are essentially negative,
but it seemed worth reporting them anyway.  The scripts used to run the
experiments and plot the results are also included for completeness.

The contents of this directory are as follows:

* `results.pdf`: a PDF containing graphs of the results and some
discussion.  This is all that most people will want to read.

<br/>

* `run-all`: a bash script which builds the different versions of the
program and runs each of them with a sequence of inputs.

* `src/`: the source code for the various machines.

* `tex/`: tex source for `results.pdf`

* `testprogs/`: the test programs

* `results/`: the results of the experiments

* `r/`: R scripts for generating graphs from the test results.
