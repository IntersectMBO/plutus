Test data concerning size increase of datatypes when removing mutual recursion from the system via the Bekic 
identity can be found [here](mutual-recursion-overhead/test-results.md).


Test data concerning the efficiency of Scott-encoded algebraic datatypes can be found [here](scott-encoding-benchmarks/results/test-results.md).


Notes concerning types that are expensive to reduce to normal form during typechecking can be found [here](expensive-types/writeup.md)

Some notes on how type-level recursion induces term-level recursion can be found [here](no-fix-value/writeup.md)

Some references on System F-omega can be found [here](https://github.com/Cubesoup/literature-review-notes/tree/master/papers). In particular, [this](https://github.com/Cubesoup/literature-review-notes/blob/master/papers/pierce-2002-types-and-programming-languages.pdf) (in Chapter 30) and [this](https://github.com/Cubesoup/literature-review-notes/blob/master/papers/brown-palsberg-2016-breaking-through-the-normalization-barrier-a-self-interpreter-for-f-omega.pdf) contain presentations of System F-omega. If you would like access to the repository containing the references, email chad.nester@iohk.io, and tell me your github username.
