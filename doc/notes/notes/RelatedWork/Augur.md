* Peer-to-peer oracle and prediction market on Ethereum


## Purpose

Augur facilitates the creation of trustless oracles and prediction markets by way of a smart contract and token (REP) implemented on Ethereum. The idea is to create financial incentives for participants to report real world information correctly and to dispute and correct information that they perceive to be incorrect.
