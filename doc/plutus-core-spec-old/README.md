This directory contains an earlier version of the Plutus Core specification.
This version has largely been superseded by the [current
version](../plutus-core-spec) but has been retained for the description of Typed
Plutus Core. The main semantic difference is that built-in functions can now be
partially applied, but in the version of Plutus Core described here they had to
be fully applied.  The description of built-in types and functions has also been
substantially extended and generalised in the new version.
