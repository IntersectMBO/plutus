# Embracing the Product Mindset

## Why

It's important for software engineers to put on the product hat from time to time, gaining firsthand experience, insights and knowledge of our products.
This is especially true for us, as our products - programming languages and compilers - are designed for and used by developers.
This makes it even more important for engineers involved in day-to-day, hands-on technical work to directly participate in product roles and processes, as they are well-positioned to understand technical nuances from a userâ€™s perspective, to study and grasp the technical details of related products, and to connect and communicate effectively with users.

Benefits of doing so include:

- Better decision making
- Early detection of pain points
- Development of better language tooling
- Increased innovation
- Improved empathy for users
- Gaining broader knowledge and new perspectives
- Personal and professional growth

## How

We'll introduce an additional sprint activity, alongside the two we currently have (making a release, and triaging issues and CIPs).

Every sprint, an engineer is chosen, who should allocate up to 3 working days on a task in one of the following categories of their choice:

- Dogfooding: build simple dapps or smart contracts and explore the full range of Plutus script functionalities, including spending, minting, stake delegation and more.
- Explore and experiment with a related product, such as Aiken, plu-ts and Plutarch.
- Explore and study smart contract language implementations on other blockchains.
- Explore and familiarize yourself with Plutus smart contract applications, such as Hydra and sidechains.
- Interact with users or observe their discussions on social media.
  You can engage by posting messages on platforms such as Discord, X, and Stack Exchange, or you can arrange direct interviews or chats.
- Try pushing the boundaries of our products, e.g., testing the limits of the compiler.

At the end of the sprint, this person should share the knowledge learned with the rest of the team.
This can be either a brief presentation or Q&A session during sprint planning, or a documented summary.

By gaining a deeper understanding of our products, users, and related products, we'll be much better equipped to identify areas for improvements and unlock new potential.
The knowledge we acquire from this will also contribute to our own personal growth, providing value that extends beyond our day-to-day tasks.
