\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
Plutus Core (more correctly, Untyped Plutus Core) is an eagerly-evaluated
version of the untyped lambda calculus extended with some ``built-in'' types and
functions; it is intended for the implementation of validation scripts on the
Cardano blockchain.  This document presents the syntax and semantics of Plutus
Core, a specification of an efficient evaluator, a description of the built-in
types and functions available in various releases of Cardano, and
a specification of the binary serialisation format used by Plutus Core.

Since Plutus Core is intended for use in an environment where
computation is potentially expensive and excessively long computations can be
problematic we have also developed a costing infrastructure for Plutus Core
programs. A description of this will be added in a later version of this
document.

We also have a typed version of Plutus Core which provides extra robustness when
untyped Plutus Core is used as a compilation target, and we will eventually
provide a specification of the type system and semantics of Typed Plutus Core
here as well, together with its relationship to Untyped Plutus Core.
