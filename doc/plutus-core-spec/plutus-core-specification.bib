abstract="We introduce the blame calculus, which adds the notion of blame from Findler and Felleisen's contracts to a system similar to Siek and Taha's gradual types and Flanagan's hybrid types. We characterise where positive and negative blame can arise by decomposing the usual notion of subtype into positive and negative subtypes, and show that these recombine to yield naive subtypes. Naive subtypes previously appeared in type systems that are unsound, but we believe this is the first time naive subtypes play a role in establishing type soundness.",

                  made recognizable by the use of one and the same (otherwise
                  irrelevant) name at all occurrences. This convention is known
                  to cause considerable trouble in cases of substitution. In the
                  present paper a different notational system is developed,
                  where occurrences of variables are indicated by integers
                  giving the “distance” to the binding λ instead of a name
                  attached to that λ. The system is claimed to be efficient for
                  automatic formula manipulation as well as for metalingual
                  discussion. As an example the most essential part of a proof
                  of the Church-Rosser theorem is presented in this namefree
