This directory contains a draft of a version of the Plutus Core specification
updated so that the language is parametric over a collection of built-in types
and functions.  It also updates the specification to reflect the fact that
built-in functions can now be partially applied.  Click
[here](./plutus-core-specification.pdf) to open the PDF.

This version is currently restricted to untyped Plutus Core only. We will add a
specification of a typed version of Plutus Core at a later date.  For the time
being, please consult the [previous version](../plutus-core-spec-old) for
information about typed Plutus Core: this is somewhat outdated, but should give
the basic idea.
