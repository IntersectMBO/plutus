\section{Built-in types and functions}
\label{sec:cardano-builtins}
\paragraph{Built-in batches.}
\label{sec:builtin-batches}

The built-in types and functions are defined in batches corresponding to how they were added to ledger languages.
These batches are given in the following sections.

\paragraph{Built-in semantics variants.}
\label{sec:builtin-semantics-variants}

In rare cases we can make a mistake or need to change the actual behaviour of a built-in function.
To handle this we define a series of built-in semantics variants, which indicate which behaviour should be used.
A fix will typically be deployed by defining a new semantics variant, and then using that variant for future ledger languages (but not existing ones, since this is usually a backwards-incompatible change).

Changes are listed alongside the original definition of the built-in function in its original batch, and are indexed in the following table.

        \hline
        Built-in semantics 1 & None \\
        Built-in semantics 2 & \TT{consByteString} (See~\ref{note:consbytestring}) \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
