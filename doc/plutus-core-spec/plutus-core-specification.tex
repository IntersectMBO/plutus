\begin{abstract}
  This is intended to be a reference guide for developers who want to utilise
  the Plutus Core infrastructure.  We lay out the grammar and syntax of untyped
  Plutus Core terms, and their semantics and evaluation rules.  We also describe
  the built-in types and functions.  The Appendices include a list of supported
  builtins in each era and some aspects of Plutus Core which have been
  mechanically formalised.
  
  This document only describes untyped Plutus Core: a subsequent version will also
  include the syntax and semantics of Typed Plutus Core and describe its relation to
  untyped Plutus Core.

\kwxm{This could still do with some tidying up.  We use a mixture of syntactic
  BNF-style notation, set-theoretic notation, and type theory, and that could
  maybe be rationalised a bit.}
