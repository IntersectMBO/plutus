Plutus Core and Plutus Tx user guide
==================================================

Plutus Core
---------------------

The Plutus project consists of Plutus Core, the programming language used for
scripts on Cardano; tooling and compilers for compiling various intermediate
languages into Plutus Core; and Plutus Tx, the compiler that compiles the Haskell
source code into Plutus Core to form the on-chain part of a contract application.
All of this is used in combination to write Plutus Core scripts that run on the
Cardano blockchain.

This documentation introduces the Plutus Core programming language and programming
with Plutus Tx. It includes explanations, tutorials, how-to instructions,
troubleshooting, and reference information.

The intended audience of this documentation includes people who want to implement
smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain. This involves using Plutus Tx to write
scripts, requiring some knowledge of the Haskell programming language.

This guide is also meant for certification companies, certification auditors,
and people who need an accurate specification. See, for example:

* the `Cardano Ledger Specification <https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger#cardano-ledger>`_ and
* the `Plutus Core Specification <https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus#specifications-and-design>`_.

The Plutus repository
----------------------------------

The `Plutus repository <https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus>`_ contains
the implementation, specification, and mechanized metatheory of Plutus Core.
It also contains the Plutus Tx compiler and the libraries, such as ``PlutusTx.List``,
for writing Haskell code that can be compiled to Plutus Core.
