   * - Option
     - Value Type
     - Default
     - Description


   * - ``conservative-optimisation``
     - Bool
     - False
     - When conservative optimisation is used, only the optimisations that never make the program worse (in terms of cost or size) are employed. Implies ``no-relaxed-float-in``.


   * - ``context-level``
     - Int
     - 1
     - Set context level for error messages.


   * - ``coverage-all``
     - Bool
     - False
     - Add all available coverage annotations in the trace output


   * - ``coverage-boolean``
     - Bool
     - False
     - Add boolean coverage annotations in the trace output


   * - ``coverage-location``
     - Bool
     - False
     - Add location coverage annotations in the trace output


   * - ``defer-errors``
     - Bool
     - False
     - If a compilation error happens and this option is turned on, the compilation error is suppressed and the original Haskell expression is replaced with a runtime-error expression.


   * - ``dump-compilation-trace``
     - Bool
     - False
     - Dump compilation trace for debugging


   * - ``dump-pir``
     - Bool
     - False
     - Dump Plutus IR


   * - ``dump-plc``
     - Bool
     - False
     - Dump Typed Plutus Core


   * - ``dump-uplc``
     - Bool
     - False
     - Dump Untyped Plutus Core


   * - ``max-simplifier-iterations-pir``
     - Int
     - 12
     - Set the max iterations for the PIR simplifier


   * - ``max-simplifier-iterations-uplc``
     - Int
     - 12
     - Set the max iterations for the UPLC simplifier


   * - ``optimize``
     - Bool
     - True
     - Run optimization passes such as simplification and floating let-bindings.


   * - ``pedantic``
     - Bool
     - False
     - Run type checker after each compilation pass


   * - ``profile-all``
     - ProfileOpts
     - None
     - Set profiling options to All, which adds tracing when entering and exiting a term.


   * - ``relaxed-float-in``
     - Bool
     - True
     - Use a more aggressive float-in pass, which often leads to reduced costs but may occasionally lead to slightly increased costs.


   * - ``remove-trace``
     - Bool
     - False
     - Eliminate calls to ``trace`` from Plutus Core


   * - ``simplifier-beta``
     - Bool
     - True
     - Run a simplification pass that performs beta transformations


   * - ``simplifier-inline``
     - Bool
     - True
     - Run a simplification pass that performs inlining


   * - ``simplifier-remove-dead-bindings``
     - Bool
     - True
     - Run a simplification pass that removes dead bindings


   * - ``simplifier-unwrap-cancel``
     - Bool
     - True
     - Run a simplification pass that cancels unwrap/wrap pairs


   * - ``strictify-bindings``
     - Bool
     - True
     - Run a simplification pass that makes bindings stricter


   * - ``target-version``
     - Version
     - 1.1.0
     - The target Plutus Core language version


   * - ``typecheck``
     - Bool
     - True
     - Perform type checking during compilation.


   * - ``verbosity``
     - Verbosity
     - Quiet
     - Set logging verbosity level (0=Quiet, 1=Verbose, 2=Debug)
