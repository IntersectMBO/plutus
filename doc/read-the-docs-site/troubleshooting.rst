Troubleshooting
===============

Plugin errors
-------------

Errors that start with ``GHC Core to PLC plugin`` are errors from ``plutus-tx-plugin``.

.. note::
   Often these errors arise due to GHC doing something to the code before the plugin gets to see it.
   So the solution is often to prevent GHC from doing this, which is why we often recommend trying various GHC compiler flags.

Haddock
~~~~~~~

The plugin will typically fail when producing Haddock documentation.
However, in this instance you can simply tell it to defer any errors to runtime (which will never happen since you're building documentation).

A easy way to do this is to add the following lines for your ``package-name`` to ``cabal.project``::

  package package-name
    haddock-options: "--optghc=-fplugin-opt PlutusTx.Plugin:defer-errors"

Non-``INLINABLE`` functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A common error is:

``Error: Reference to a name which is not a local, a builtin, or an external INLINABLE function``

This means the plugin doesn't have access to implementation of the function, which it needs to be able to compile the function to Plutus Core.
Some things you can do to fix it:

- Make sure to add ``{-# INLINABLE functionname #-}`` to your function.
- If there's an extra ``$c`` in front of the function name in the error, GHC has generated a specialised version of your function,
  which prevents the plugin from accessing it.
  You can turn off specialisation with ``{-# OPTIONS_GHC -fno-specialise #-}``
- Other compiler options that can help:

  - ``{-# OPTIONS_GHC -fno-strictness #-}``
  - ``{-# OPTIONS_GHC -fno-ignore-interface-pragmas #-}``
  - ``{-# OPTIONS_GHC -fno-omit-interface-pragmas #-}``
  - ``{-# OPTIONS_GHC -fobject-code #-}``

  Some more details are in `the plutus-tx readme <https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/tree/master/plutus-tx#building-projects-with-plutus-tx>`_.

Haskell Language Server issues
------------------------------

For more advice on using Haskell Language Server (HLS), consult the `CONTRIBUTING guide <https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.adoc>`_ in the ``plutus`` repository.

Wrong version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``ghcide compiled against GHC 8.10.3 but currently using 8.10.2.20201118``

Your editor is not picking up the right version of the Haskell Language Server (HLS).
Plutus needs a custom version of HLS which is provided by Nix.
So get this working in your editor, make sure to do these two things:

- Start your editor from ``nix develop`` (or use ``direnv``)
- Most editors are configured to use ``haskell-language-server-wrapper``, which is a wrapper which picks the right HLS version.
  Change this to just ``haskell-language-server``.

If this doesn't work, run ``which haskell-language-server`` in `nix develop`, and use this absolute path in the configuration of your editor.

Error codes
-----------

To reduce code size, on-chain errors only output codes. Here's what they mean:

..
  This list can be generated with:
  grep -rEoh "\btrace\w*\s+\"[^\"]{1,5}\"\s+(--.*|\{-\".*\"-\})" *
