Quick Start
=================================

The easiest way to create a Cardano smart contract is to use the `plutus-tx-template <https://github.com/IntersectMBO/plutus-tx-template>`_ repository template.

Follow the instructions inside the `README.md` to setup your environment and run the example project.

There are several other options for writing on-chain validators, such as `Aiken <https://aiken-lang.org/>`_ and `OpShin <https://github.com/OpShin/opshin>`_, and you can refer to their respective documentation for how to use them.
