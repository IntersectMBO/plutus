-- | Commands, in CQRS parlance, are inbound message which will
-- will be processed into events to put in the event store.
--
-- Commands in 'eventful' are handled by a function:
--
-- > state -> command -> [event]
--
-- What's the 'state'? A projection, which allows us keep the
-- up-to-date results of any query over the event database.
--
-- These two things are bundled up in an 'Aggregate'. So for example,
-- you might have an aggregate whose state was, "the details of all
-- open orders" and a command, "Order 123 was dispatched," yielding
-- the two events, @OrderDispatched 123@ and @NotificationSent
-- "steve\@iohk.com"@.
--
-- Of note in this module is the use of 'nullProjection' as a way of
-- ignoring the 'state'.
