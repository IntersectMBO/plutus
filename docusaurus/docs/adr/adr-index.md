# Architectural decision records

We document our architectural and design decisions for all of our components. 
To do that, there is a practice called architectural decision records (ADR), that we can integrate into our workflow. 
An ADR is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

The goals are:

- Making decisions transparent to internal/external stakeholders and contributors
- Getting feedback on decisions that we're about to make or have made
- Providing external contributors with a framework to propose architectural changes
- Providing a big picture of all major decisions that were made.

The general process for creating an ADR is:

1. Cloning the repository
2. Creating a new file with the format:
    `[<ADR_NUMBER\>-<TITLE>.md]` in the directory `[doc/adr]`
3. Adding the ADR in the table of contents tree of the documentation
4. Committing and pushing to the repository.
