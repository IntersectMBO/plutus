{- Note [Cabal hooks for Agda]
We want to run Agda to generate some of the Haskell sources for this project.

We do this with cabal hooks. The considerations are:
- We need it to run before Haddock also
- We want the Haskell to be regenerated if the Agda has changed before building the
Haskell.

This is tricky: the first point suggests having a post-configure hook, but then the
second won't work, since Cabal won't detect that it needs to reconfigure if the
Agda changes.

The only way is to rely on Agda to do the change detection, and run it every time.
That means we need a pre-build hook. But then it won't run before Haddock!

So: we do both! Since Agda is reasonably good at not redoing work, we mostly don't
pay the cost twice on the first configure/build sequence.
