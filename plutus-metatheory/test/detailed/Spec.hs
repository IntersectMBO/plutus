{- These tests were previously broken because they produced textual output from
different progams and then compared them using Agda functions like
Evaluator.Term.alphaTm, which read them back in using the PLC/UPLC parsers and
then compare them up to alpha-equivalence.  The problem is that the Agda
evaluators only produce output whose variables are (non-unique) names with de
Bruijn indices appended and the Haskell parsers can't parse those.  This led to
test failures which were (a) unexpected, and (b) confusing because `alphaTm`
will return `False` for two identical inputs which don't parse even though they
look the same.

The current code works around this by converting the textual output to a
canonical form which only involves de Bruijn indices and comparing the strings
directly.  This depends crucially on names with de Bruijn indices being of the
form `[A-Za-z0-9_]*![0-9]+`.

{- | This takes a string with de Bruijn indices of the form abc!456 and converts
   them to things like !456.  We actually take a reversed string and when we
   find a digit we seek along the string for a '!'; if we find one then we skip
   all characters after it which are allowed in textual IDs until we get to one
   that isn't.  Conveniently `squashRev` provides us with a reversed string for
   input to this function. -}

    {- go2: copy all digits to the output until we find a '!'; after that drop all
     characters that might appear in a textual name.  Strictly we should also
     check that the final character is an identifierStartingChar and maybe also
     account for quoted ideintfiers. -}
    go2 [] acc       = acc

{- | Convert a textual PLC term containing de Bruijn-named variables of the form id!index
to a canonical form.

eg, "(lam var!0   [(  builtin    addInteger)   var!1 x!4  ])"
 -> "(lam !0 [( builtin addInteger) var!1 x!4 ])"

The main point of this is to (a) ignore everything in names apart from the de
Bruijn index, and (b) to remove newlines and indentation.  This could be
misleading if a program happens tocontain a literal string that has a substring
that looks like one of our de Bruijn-named variables.  However that seems very
improbable, and for it to cause problems in our tests we'd need to have two
terms that contain literal strings in the same place which have different
de-Bruijn-like substrings, which seems even more unlikely.
