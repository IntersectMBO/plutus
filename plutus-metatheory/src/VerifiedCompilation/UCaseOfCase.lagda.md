## Translation Relation

This compiler stage only applies to the very specific case where an `IfThenElse` builtin exists in a `case` expression.
It moves the `IfThenElse` outside and creates two `case` expressions with each of the possible lists of cases. 

This will just be an instance of the `Translation` relation once we define the "before" and "after" patterns.

```
data CoC : Relation where
  isCoC : {X : Set} → (b : X ⊢) (tn fn : ℕ)  (tt tt' ft ft' alts alts' : List (X ⊢)) →
             Pointwise (Translation CoC) alts alts' →
             Pointwise (Translation CoC) tt tt' →
             Pointwise (Translation CoC) ft ft' →
             CoC
               (case ((((force (builtin ifThenElse)) · b) · (constr tn tt)) · (constr fn ft)) alts)
               (force ((((force (builtin ifThenElse)) · b) · (delay (case (constr tn tt') alts'))) · (delay (case (constr fn ft') alts'))))

UntypedCaseOfCase : {X : Set} {{_ : DecEq X}} → (ast : X ⊢) → (ast' : X ⊢) → Set₁
UntypedCaseOfCase = Translation CoC

```
## Decision Procedure

Since this compiler phase is just a syntax re-arrangement in a very particular situation, we can
match on that situation in the before and after ASTs and apply the translation rule for this, or
expect anything else to be unaltered.

This translation matches on exactly one, very specific pattern. Using parameterised Views we can
detect that case. We create two "views" for the two patterns - we will tie together the variables in the
later function `isCoC?`.
```

  isCoCCase : (b : X ⊢) (tn fn : ℕ)  (tt ft alts : List (X ⊢)) → CoCCase (case ((((force (builtin ifThenElse)) · b) · (constr tn tt)) · (constr fn ft)) alts)

                                                                                 (isapp
                                                                                  (isapp (isapp (isforce (isbuiltin ifThenElse)) (isterm b))

                                                                                 (allterms ft)) }

isCoCForce? t with (isForce? (isApp? (isApp? (isApp? (isForce? isBuiltin?) isTerm?) (isDelay? (isCase? (isConstr? allTerms?) allTerms?))) (isDelay? (isCase? (isConstr? allTerms?) allTerms?)))) t
... | no ¬CoCForce = no λ { (isCoCForce b tn fn tt' ft' alts') → ¬CoCForce
                                                                  (isforce
                                                                   (isapp
                                                                    (isapp (isapp (isforce (isbuiltin ifThenElse)) (isterm b))
                                                                     (isdelay (iscase (isconstr tn (allterms tt')) (allterms alts'))))
                                                                    (isdelay (iscase (isconstr fn (allterms ft')) (allterms alts')))))}

... | no ¬p = no λ { (isCoCForce .b .tn .fn .tt' .ft' .alts') → ¬p (refl , refl) }

```
We can now create the final decision procedure. Because the translation can be applied recursively we need
the individual pattern decision `isCoC?` and the overall translation decision `isUntypedCaseOfCase?` to be mutually
recursive, so the `isUntypedCaseOfCase?` type declaration comes first, with the implementation later.

```
isUntypedCaseOfCase? : {X : Set} {{_ : DecEq X}} → Binary.Decidable (Translation CoC {X})

{-# TERMINATING #-}
isCoC? : {X : Set} {{_ : DecEq X}} → Binary.Decidable (CoC {X})
isCoC? ast ast' with (isCoCCase? ast) ×-dec (isCoCForce? ast')
... | no ¬cf = no λ { (isCoC b tn fn tt tt' ft ft' alts alts' x x₁ x₂) → ¬cf
                                                                          (isCoCCase b tn fn tt ft alts , isCoCForce b tn fn tt' ft' alts') }
... | yes (isCoCCase b tn fn tt ft alts , isCoCForce b₁ tn₁ fn₁ tt' ft' alts') with (b ≟ b₁) ×-dec (tn ≟ tn₁) ×-dec (fn ≟ fn₁) ×-dec (decPointwise isUntypedCaseOfCase? tt tt') ×-dec (decPointwise isUntypedCaseOfCase? ft ft') ×-dec (decPointwise isUntypedCaseOfCase? alts alts')
... | yes (refl , refl , refl , ttpw , ftpw , altpw) = yes (isCoC b tn fn tt tt' ft ft' alts alts' altpw ttpw ftpw)
... | no ¬p = no λ { (isCoC .b .tn .fn .tt .tt' .ft .ft' .alts .alts' x x₁ x₂) → ¬p (refl , refl , refl , x₁ , x₂ , x) }

isUntypedCaseOfCase? {X} = translation? {X} isCoC? 
```

## Semantic Equivalence

We can show that this translation never alters the semantics of the statement. This is shown
in terms of the CEK machine evaluation. Since it is a simple re-arrangement of the syntax, it
isn't a refinement argument - the state before and after the operation is the same type, and is
unaltered buy the syntax re-arrangement.

This does rely on the encoding of the semantics of `IfThenElse` in the CEK module, since we
need to show that the effective list of cases is the same as it would have been without the re-arrangement.

The `stepper` function uses the CEK machine to evaluate a term. Here we call it with a very
large gas budget and begin in an empty context (which assumes the term is closed).

```
-- TODO: Several approaches are possible. 
--semantic_equivalence : ∀ {X set} {ast ast' : ⊥ ⊢}
 --                    → ⊥ ⊢̂ ast ⊳̂ ast'
 -- <Some stuff about whether one runs out of gas -- as long as neither runs out of gas, _then_ they are equivilent> 
 --                    → (stepper maxsteps  (Stack.ϵ ; [] ▻ ast)) ≡ (stepper maxsteps (Stack.ε ; [] ▻ ast'))

-- ∀ {s : ℕ} → stepper s ast ≡ <valid terminate state> ⇔ ∃ { s' : ℕ } [ stepper s' ast' ≡ <same valid terminate state> ] 
```
