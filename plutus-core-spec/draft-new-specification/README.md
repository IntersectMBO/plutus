This directory containts a draft of a version of the Plutus Core specification
updated so that the language is parametric over a collection of built-in types
and functions.  It also updates the specification to reflect the fact that
built-in functions can now be partially applied.

This version is currently restricted to untyped Plutus Core only. We will add a
specification of a typed version of Plutus Core at a later date.
