abstract="Lambda calculi are often used as intermediate representations for compilers. However, they require extensions to handle higher-level features of programming languages. In this paper we show how to construct an IR based on {\$}{\$}{\backslash}text {\{}System{\}}{\backslash} F{\_}{\{}{\backslash}omega {\}}^{\backslash}mu {\$}{\$}which supports recursive functions and datatypes, and describe how to compile it to {\$}{\$}{\backslash}text {\{}System{\}}{\backslash} F{\_}{\{}{\backslash}omega {\}}^{\backslash}mu {\$}{\$}. Our IR was developed for commercial use at the IOHK company, where it is used as part of a compilation pipeline for smart contracts running on a blockchain.",

abstract="System F, also known as the polymorphic {\$}{\$}{\backslash}lambda {\$}{\$}-calculus, is a typed {\$}{\$}{\backslash}lambda {\$}{\$}-calculus independently discovered by the logician Jean-Yves Girard and the computer scientist John Reynolds. We consider {\$}{\$}F{\_}{\{}{\backslash}omega {\backslash}mu {\}}{\$}{\$}, which adds higher-order kinds and iso-recursive types. We present the first complete, intrinsically typed, executable, formalisation of System {\$}{\$}F{\_}{\{}{\backslash}omega {\backslash}mu {\}}{\$}{\$}that we are aware of. The work is motivated by verifying the core language of a smart contract system based on System {\$}{\$}F{\_}{\{}{\backslash}omega {\backslash}mu {\}}{\$}{\$}. The paper is a literate Agda script [14].",
