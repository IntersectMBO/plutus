== Introduction

Plutus Core is the scripting language embedded in the Cardano ledger and forms the basis of the Plutus Platform, an application development platform for developing distributed applications using the Cardano blockchain.

For more information about the projects, see the <<user-documentation>>.

This repository contains:

* The implementation, specification, and mechanized metatheory of Plutus Core
* Plutus Tx, the compiler from Haskell to Plutus Core.

The rest of this README is focussed on people who want to develop or contribute to the project.

For people who want to *use* the project, please consult the <<user-documentation>>.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This repository used to contain the code for the Plutus Application Framework and Marlowe.
These have now *moved*:

- https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-apps[Plutus Application Framework]
- https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano[Marlowe]

Please ensure that you make PRs and issues in the appropriate repository!

== Development

[[how-to-develop]]
=== How to develop and contribute to the project

Run `nix develop` to enter the development shell and you will be presented with a list of available commands.

**Please see link:CONTRIBUTING{outfilesuffix}[CONTRIBUTING] for comprehensive documentation on how to contribute to the project, including development and submitting changes*

=== How to submit an issue

Issues can be filed in the https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/issues[GitHub Issue tracker].

=== How to depend on the project from another Haskell project

None of our libraries are on Hackage, unfortunately (many of our dependencies aren't either).
So for the time being, you need to:

. Add `plutus` as a `source-repository-package` to your `cabal.project`.
. Copy the `source-repository-package` stanzas from our `cabal.project` to yours.
. Copy additional stanzas from our `cabal.project` as you need, e.g. you may need some of the `allow-newer` stanzas.

The https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-starter[plutus-starter] project provides an example.
