:author: Input Output HK

The Plutus Platform enables you to:

* Work with Plutus Core, the smart contract language embedded in the Cardano
ledger.
* Write Haskell programs that create and use embedded Plutus Core programs.
* Write smart contract executables which can be distributed for use with a
Cardano wallet backend.

You are free to copy, modify, and distribute the Plutus Platform with
under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license. See the link:./LICENSE[LICENSE]
and link:./NOTICE[NOTICE] files for details.

== How to use the project

[[prerequisites]]
=== Prerequisites

The Haskell libraries in the Plutus Platform can be built in a number of ways. The prerequisites depend
on how you want to build the libraries. The other artifacts (docs etc.) are most easily built with Nix,
so we recommend installing it regardless.

* https://nixos.org/nix/[Nix] (recommended).
** Install Nix following the instructions on the https://nixos.org/nix/[Nix website].
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Even if you already have Nix installed, make sure to set up the xref:iohk-binary-cache[IOHK binary cache].
====
** See the section on xref:nix[Nix] for further advice on using Nix.
* https://www.haskell.org/cabal/[`cabal`] (if building Haskell packages with `cabal`).
* https://haskellstack.org/[`stack`] (if building Haskell packages with `stack`).

=== How to build the Haskell packages and other artifacts

[[building-with-nix]]
=== How to build Haskell packages and other artifacts with Nix

Run `nix build -f default.nix localPackages.language-plutus-core`
from the root to build the Plutus Core library.

See the section on xref:nix-build-attributes[Nix build attributes] to find out
what other attributes you can build.

=== How to build Haskell packages with `cabal`

Run `cabal v2-build language-plutus-core` from the root to build the
Plutus Core library.

See the link:./cabal.project[cabal project file] to see the other
projects that you can build with `cabal`.

=== How to build the Haskell packages with `stack`

Run `stack build language-plutus-core` from the root to build the
Plutus Core library.

See the link:./stack.yaml[stack project file] to see the other
projects that you can build with stack.

=== How to run a local Plutus Playground in a Docker container

1. Install Docker following the instructions on the https://docs.docker.com/[Docker website].
2. Run `nix build -f default.nix docker.plutusPlaygroundImage`, to build
3. Run `docker load < docker-image-plutus-playgrounds.tar.gz` - this will
print out the image name at the end, e.g. `Loaded image: plutus-playgrounds:yn7h7m5qdjnnj9rxv8cgkvvwjkkcdnvp`
4. Run `docker run -p 8080:8080 plutus-playgrounds:yn7h7m5qdjnnj9rxv8cgkvvwjkkcdnvp`
using the image name from the previous step.
5. Open http://localhost:8080/ in a web browser.

== Where to go next

=== Where to find tutorials

The link:./plutus-tutorial/README{outfilesuffix}[plutus-tutorial] project contains a basic tutorial
for using the Plutus Platform to write smart contracts.

To build a full HTML version of the tutorial that you can view locally, build the `docs.plutus-tutorial` xref:building-with-nix[using Nix].

=== Where to find the changelog

The changelog is stored in link:./CHANGELOG.md[CHANGELOG].

=== How to communicate with us

We’re active on the https://forum.cardano.org/[Cardano
forum]. Tag your post with the `plutus` tag so we’ll see it.

Use the Github issue tracker for bugs and feature requests, but keep
other discussions to the forum.

=== How to contribute to the project

See link:CONTRIBUTING{outfilesuffix}[CONTRIBUTING], which describes our processes in more detail.

[[iohk-binary-cache]]
=== How to set up the IOHK binary caches

Adding the IOHK binary cache to your Nix configuration will speed up
builds a lot, since many things will have been built already by our CI.

If you find you are building packages that are not defined in this
repository, or if the build seems to take a very long time then you may
not have this set up properly.

To set up the cache:

. If you are a not a trusted user (or you do not
know whether you are a trusted user), then edit `/etc/nix/nix.conf`. If
you are not a trusted user, you may edit `~/.config/nix/nix.conf`
instead.
. Add the following lines:
+
----
substituters        = https://hydra.iohk.io https://cache.nixos.org/
trusted-public-keys = hydra.iohk.io:f/Ea+s+dFdN+3Y/G+FDgSq+a5NEWhJGzdjvKNGv0/EQ= cache.nixos.org-1:6NCHdD59X431o0gWypbMrAURkbJ16ZPMQFGspcDShjY=
----

=== How to get a development environment

While developing the libraries, you probably will not want to use Nix to
build all the libraries. If you want to use `cabal v2-build` to build
the local projects only, then:
. Run `nix-shell`.
. Run `cabal v2-build` as normal.


[[nix-build-attributes]]
=== Which attributes to use to build different artifacts

link:./default.nix[`default.nix`] defines a package set with attributes for all the
artifacts you can build from this repository. These can be built
using `nix build`. For example:

----
nix build -f default.nix localPackages.language-plutus-core
----

.Example attributes
* Local packages: defined inside `localPackages`
** e.g. `localPackages.language-plutus-core`
* Documents: defined inside `docs`
** e.g. `docs.plutus-core-spec`
* Development scripts: defined inside `dev`
** e.g. `dev.scripts.fixStylishHaskell`

There are other attributes defined in link:./default.nix[`default.nix`].
