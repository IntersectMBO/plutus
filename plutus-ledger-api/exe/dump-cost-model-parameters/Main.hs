{- | This executable prints out the cost model parameters according to the various
    `PlutusLedgerApi.V<n>.ParamName types`.  These determine both the cost model
    parameters included in the protocol parameters (and hence which Plutus
    builtins are available to each Plutus ledger language version) and the order
    in which they occur.  The protocol parameters and the ledger both treat the
    cost model parameters as ordered lists of integers and know nothing about
    the names of the parameters (see
    `cardano-ledger/libs/cardano-ledger-core/src/Cardano/Ledger/Plutus/CostModels.hs`
    for how the ledger (and also cardano-api and cardano-cli) deals with cost
    models), and the `ParamName` types provide the link between the lists of
    parameters and the complex structure used to represent a cost model in
    Plutus Core.  New cost models (possibly enabling new builtins) are
    propagated to the chain by protocol updates which update the cost model
    parameters, and this executable produces lists of cost model parameters in a
    form suitable for inclusion in the protocol parameters, and so can be helpful
    when we need to propose new parameters for use on the chain, and to check
    that the on-chain parameters are as expected.  Note that this code deals
    only with the cost model parameters in the current state of the `plutus`
    repository, which may differ from those on the chain: specifically, the cost
    model parameters dealt with by this code will often be those which are
    expected to come into effect at the next hard fork and hence will be ahead
    of those currently in use for new script executions on the chain.  The exact
    structure of the cost model used by a particular ledger language is
    determined by a _semantic variant_ which depends on both the ledger language
    and the protocol version (see the `mkEvaluationContext` functions in the
    various `EvaluationContext` files), and this code will need to be updated
    if, for example, a new Plutus Ledger language is added or the structure of
    the cost model used by an existing ledger language changes.
