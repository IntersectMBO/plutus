-- | This represents the major component of the Cardano protocol version.

{- Note [Mapping of protocol versions and ledger languages to semantics variants]
Semantics variants depend on both the protocol version and the ledger language.

Here's a table specifying the mapping in full:

  pv pre-Conway post-Conway
ll
1       A           B
2       A           B
3       C           C

I.e. for example

- post-Conway 'PlutusV1' corresponds to 'DefaultFunSemanticsVariantB'
- pre-Conway  'PlutusV2' corresponds to 'DefaultFunSemanticsVariantA'
- post-Conway 'PlutusV3' corresponds to 'DefaultFunSemanticsVariantC'
