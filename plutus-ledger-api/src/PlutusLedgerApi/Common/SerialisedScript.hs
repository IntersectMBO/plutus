{- Note [Size checking of constants in PLC programs]
We impose a 64-byte *on-the-wire* limit on the constants inside PLC programs. This prevents people from inserting
Mickey Mouse entire.

This is somewhat inconvenient for users, but they can always send multiple bytestrings and
concatenate them at runtime.

Unfortunately this check was broken in the ledger Plutus language version V1, and so for backwards compatibility
we only perform it in V2 and above.

type SerialisedScript = ShortByteString

-- | A variant of `Script` with a specialized decoder.
newtype ScriptForExecution = ScriptForExecution (UPLC.Program UPLC.NamedDeBruijn DefaultUni DefaultFun ())

{-| This decoder decodes the names directly into `NamedDeBruijn`s rather than `DeBruijn`s.
This is needed because the CEK machine expects `NameDeBruijn`s, but there are obviously no names in the serialised form of a `Script`.
Rather than traversing the term and inserting fake names after deserialising, this lets us do at the same time as deserialising.

{-| Check if a 'Script' is "valid" according to a protocol version. At the moment this means "deserialises correctly", which in particular
implies that it is (almost certainly) an encoded script and the script does not mention any builtins unavailable in the given protocol version.

Note: Parameterized over the ledger-plutus-version since the builtins allowed (during decoding) differs.
