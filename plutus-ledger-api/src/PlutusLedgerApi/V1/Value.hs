{- Note [Value vs value]
We call two completely different things "values": the 'Value' type and a value within a key-value
pair. To distinguish between the two we write the former with a capital "V" and enclosed in single
quotes and we write the latter with a lower case "v" and without the quotes, i.e. 'Value' vs value.
-}

{- Note [Optimising Value]

We have attempted to improve the performance of 'Value' and other usages of
'PlutusTx.AssocMap.Map' by choosing a different representation for 'PlutusTx.AssocMap.Map',
see https://github.com/IntersectMBO/plutus/pull/5697.
This approach has been found to not be suitable, as the PR's description mentions.

Another approach was to define a specialised 'ByteStringMap', where the key type was 'BuiltinByteString',
since that is the representation of both 'CurrencySymbol' and 'TokenName'.
Unfortunately, this approach actually had worse performance in practice. We believe it is worse
because having two map libraries would make some optimisations, such as CSE, less effective.
We base this on the fact that turning off all optimisations ended up making the code more performant.
See https://github.com/IntersectMBO/plutus/pull/5779 for details on the experiment done.

-- See Note [Value vs value].
-- See Note [Optimising Value].
{- | The 'Value' type represents a collection of amounts of different currencies.
We can think of 'Value' as a vector space whose dimensions are currencies.

Operations on currencies are usually implemented /pointwise/. That is,
we apply the operation to the quantities for each currency in turn. So
when we add two 'Value's the resulting 'Value' has, for each currency,
the sum of the quantities of /that particular/ currency in the argument
'Value'. The effect of this is that the currencies in the 'Value' are "independent",
and are operated on separately.

Whenever we need to get the quantity of a currency in a 'Value' where there
is no explicit quantity of that currency in the 'Value', then the quantity is
taken to be zero.

There is no 'Ord Value' instance since 'Value' is only a partial order, so 'compare' can't
do the right thing in some cases.

{- | Check equality of two lists of distinct key-value pairs, each value being uniquely
identified by a key, given a function checking whether a 'Value' is zero and a function
checking equality of values. Note that the caller must ensure that the two lists are
well-defined in this sense. This is not checked or enforced in `unordEqWith`, and therefore
it might yield undefined results for ill-defined input.

This function recurses on both the lists in parallel and checks whether the key-value pairs are
equal pointwise. If there is a mismatch, then it tries to find the left key-value pair in the right
list. If that succeeds then the pair is removed from both the lists and recursion proceeds pointwise
as before until there's another mismatch. If at some point a key-value pair from the left list is
not found in the right one, then the function returns 'False'. If the left list is exhausted, but
the right one still has some non-zero elements, the function returns 'False' as well.

We check equality of values of two key-value pairs right after ensuring that the keys match. This is
disadvantageous if the values are big and there's a key that is present in one of the lists but not
in the other, since in that case computing equality of values was expensive and pointless. However

1. we've checked and on the chain 'Value's very rarely contain 'CurrencySymbol's with more than 3
   'TokenName's associated with them, so we optimize for the most common use case
2. computing equality of values before ensuring equality of all the keys certainly does help when we
   check equality of 'TokenName'-value pairs, since the value of a 'TokenName' is an 'Integer' and
   @(==) :: Integer -> Integer -> Bool@ is generally much faster than repeatedly searching for keys
   in a list
3. having some clever logic for computing equality of values right away in some cases, but not in
   others would not only complicate the algorithm, but also increase the size of the function and
   this resource is quite scarce as the size of a program growing beyond what's acceptable by the
   network can be a real deal breaker, while general performance concerns don't seem to be as
   pressing

The algorithm we use here is very similar, if not identical, to @valueEqualsValue4@ from
