{- Note [Manually constructing scripts]
The scripts we provide here are *manually* constructed Plutus Core. Why not use our great machinery for easily creating
scripts with Plutus Tx? Because Plutus Tx relies on a compiler plugin, and so is always going to be a bit finicky to user.
It seems better therefore to avoid depending on Plutus Tx in any "core" projects like the ledger.
