### Changed

- The `ScriptContext` type for Plutus V3 is modified to contain an optional datum for
  spending scripts, in the `scriptContextScriptInfo` field. The redeemer is now also
  part of `ScriptContext`. As a result, all Plutus V3 scripts, regardless of the purpose,
  take a single argument: `ScriptContext`.
- Datum is now optional for Plutus V3 spending scripts.
