# This file is provided here for development purposes only. In deployment,
# settings are taken from `deployment/morph/machines/marlowe-dash.nix` (which
# also determines which contracts are available). In most cases we use the
# default settings - the main thing to watch out for is that the
# `scZeroSlotTime` here coincides with the frontend code's assumptions about
# the time of slot 0 (in `web-common-marlowe/src/Marlowe/Slot.purs`).

# Optional timeout (in seconds) for calls to endpoints that are not currently
# available. If this is not set, calls to unavailable endpoints fail
# immediately.
# The endpoints on Marlowe contracts are always available, so in principle
# this isn't an issue here. However, there is a split second between creating
# a contract and the endpoints first becoming available - so having this set
# ensures that the first attempt to call an endpoint (immediately after
# creating the contract) won't fail.
