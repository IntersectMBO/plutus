{- [Workflow 2][6] Connect a wallet
If we have just connected a wallet (and the walletCompanionStatus is still `FirstUpdatePending`),
then we know the `MarloweFollower` apps that are running in this wallet, and have just been given
the current state of its `WalletCompanion` app for the first time since connecting. If the status
of the `WalletCompanion` app contains a record of `MarloweParams` for any _new_ Marlowe contracts
(created since the last time we connected this wallet, and for which we therefore have no
corresponding `MarloweFollowr` apps), we now need to create `MarloweFollower` apps for those new
contracts.
In this case, we change the walletCompanionStatus to `LoadingNewContracts`, and subscribe to every
new `MarloweFollower`. We'll know the loading is finished when we've received the first status
update for each of these `MarloweFollower` apps through the WebSocket.
-}
{- [Workflow 4][2] Start a Marlowe contract
After starting a new Marlowe contract, we should receive a WebSocket notification informing us of
the `MarloweParams` and initial `MarloweData` for that contract (via a status update for our
`WalletCompanion` app). We now need to start following that contract with a `MarloweFollower` app.
If we started the contract ourselves, we already created a `MarloweFollower` app as a placeholder.
So here we need to check whether there is an existing `MarloweFollower` app with the right metadata
(and no `MarloweParams`) - and potentially use that instead of creating a new one.
If someone else started the contract, and gave us a role, we will have no placeholder
`MarloweFollower` app, and so we simply create a new one and start following immediately.

        -- Note [PendingContracts]: Okay, here's the problem: When we're using the PAB, and a contract is created,
        -- we create a follower app immediately as a placeholder (and remember its PlutusAppId), then we wait for
        -- the wallet companion app to tell us the MarloweParams of the contract we created, and pass those to the
        -- pending follower app. Fine. But when we're using the LocalStorage as our dataProvider, this workflow
        -- doesn't quite work. This is because the LocalStorage doesn't keep a record of PlutusAppIds, but just
        -- derives them as a function of the MarloweParams (see note [MarloweParams] in Capability.Marlowe). So
        -- when we create a pending follower app with LocalStorage, we get back what is ultimately the wrong
        -- PlutusAppId (and we can't know the right one until we've generated the MarloweParams). At that point we
        -- could try to update the PlutusAppId, but it's simpler to just delete the pending follower app and
        -- create a new one with the right ID (and the right key in the contracts map).
        --
        -- This solution is ugly for two reasons: (1) In general, the Marlowe capability should be the only thing
        -- that cares about the dataProvider and does things differently depending on what it is. (2) In particular,
        -- what we're doing here means that the LocalStorage implementations of `createPendingFollowerApp` and
        -- `followContractWithPendingFollowerApp` are completely pointless (the first one is called at the
        -- appropriate point, but here we just delete the pending follower app that it created without making any
        -- use of it; and the second is never even called).
        --
        -- (Note: There are sensible LocalStorage implementations of these useless functions in the Marlowe capability.
        -- Why? Because I wrote them before I realised that the simplest solution to the present problem would be to
        -- stop using them. I might as well leave them there in case they become useful again at some point.)
        --
        -- But the good news is that all of this is for the bin anyway, as soon as the PAB is working fully and we can
        -- get rid of the LocalStorage hack altogether. So I think in the meantime this will do (and I don't want to

{- [Workflow 2][8] Connect a wallet
If this is the first update we are receiving from a new `MarloweFollower` app that was created
after we connected the wallet, but _before_ the walletCompanionStatus was set to
`FirstUpdateComplete`, we need to remove the app from the `LoadingNewContracts` set. And if it's
the last element of that set, we can set the walletCompanionStatus to `FirstUpdateComplete`. This
(finally!) completes the workflow of connecting a wallet.

created a `MarloweFollower` app for that contract, and started following the contract with that

about its initial state through the WebSocket. We potentially use that to change the corresponding

{- [Workflow 6][1] Redeem payments
This action is triggered every time we receive a status update for a `MarloweFollower` app. The
handler looks, in the corresponding contract, for any payments to roles for which the current
wallet holds the token, and then calls the "redeem" endpoint of the wallet's `MarloweApp` for each
one, to make sure those funds reach the user's wallet (without the user having to do anything).
This is not very sophisticated, and results in the "redeem" endpoint being called more times than
necessary (we are not attempting to keep track of which payments have already been redeemed). Also,
we thought it would be more user-friendly for now to trigger this automatically - but when we
integrate with real wallets, I'm pretty sure we will need to provide a UI for the user to do it
manually (and sign the transaction). So this will almost certainly have to change.
