-- The execution state represents the status of a Marlowe contract synced with the PAB.
-- It is currently optmized for speed and ease of computation at expense of storage and clear
-- boundaries. For example in the history array we store the balance prior and after the
-- transaction input, and for timeouts we store the missed actions. This information is needed
-- only by the contract carousel (only 1 open at a time), but it's pre-calculated for all
-- contracts (even the closed ones).
-- At a later point, we might want to refactor the execution state to live outside the component
-- state, as a global state (using https://github.com/thomashoneyman/purescript-halogen-store),
-- and minimize the amount of cached information.

-- This represents the timeouts that haven't been applied to the contract. When a step of a
-- contract has timed out, nothing happens until the next TransactionInput. This could be an
-- IDeposit or IChoose for the continuation contract, or an empty transaction to advance or even
-- close the contract. We store a separate ContractAndState from the "current" ContractAndState because
-- this is the predicted state that we would be in if we applied an empty transaction, and this
-- allows us to extract the NamedActions that need to be applied next. Also, we store the timeouts
-- as an Array because it is possible that multiple continuations have timedout before we advance
-- the contract.
