-- MarloweParams are used to identify a Marlowe contract in the PAB, and the wallet
-- companion contract state is a Map MarloweParams MarloweData. We are not currently
-- generating PureScript types to match the Haskell MarloweParams and MarloweData
-- types (side note: perhaps we should be). We have a CurrencySymbol type in
-- Marlowe.Semantics, but it is just an alias for String. We could use that here for
-- the `rolesCurrency` value, and convert using its Bridge instance when sharing data
-- with the PAB. However, we currently don't need to do anything with MarloweParams on
-- the frontend except save them and send them back to the PAB (to join a contract that
-- is already running), so it is simpler just to use the generated type in this case.
