The Marlowe Run app consists of six main workflows:

1. Generate a demo wallet (this will become redundant when we integrate with real wallets).
2. Connect a wallet (this will change when we integrate with real wallets).
3. Disconnect a wallet.
4. Start a contract.
5. Move a contract forward.
6. Redeem payments (this is triggered automatically - but may need to be manual when we
   integrate with real wallets).

There are two main application states: the `Welcome` state (for workflows 1 and 2), and the
`Dashboard` state (for workflows 3-6). Initially we are in the `Welcome` state. Connecting a wallet
(workflow 2) moves you into the `Dashboard` state; disconnecting a wallet (workflow 4) moves you
back into the `Welcome` state.

Because of the synchronous nature of the app, with messages passing between the browser and the PAB
(both through direct API calls and a WebSocket), these workflows are in general spread out all over
the code. Comments are added throughout with the format "[Workflow n][m]" - so you can search the
code for e.g. "[Workflow 4]" to see all of the steps involved in starting a contract.

-- Note [State]: Some actions belong logically in one part of the state, but
-- from the user's point of view in another. For example, the action of picking
-- up a wallet belongs logically in the MainFrame state (because it modifies
-- that state), but from the user's point of view it belongs in the Pickup
-- state (because that's the state the app is in when you perform it). To work
-- around this, we can either make our `handleAction` functions a bit awkward,
-- or our `render` functions a bit awkward. I prefer the former. Hence some
-- submodule actions (triggered straightforwardly in the submodule's `render`
-- functions) are handled by their parent module's `handleAction` function.

If the wallet has been given a role token for a new contract while the user was disconnected, they
will not yet have a `MarloweFollower` app for that contract. The business of creating and loading
these apps (and avoiding the UI bug of saying "you have no contracts" when in fact we haven't
finished loading them yet) is a bit convoluted - follow the trail of workflow comments to see how
it works.
