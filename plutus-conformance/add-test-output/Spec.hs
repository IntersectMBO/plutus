-- | This executable is for easy addition of tests. When run,
-- output files will be added to all tests that had no output files.
-- You are advised to manually check that the output is correct.
-- In other parts of the codebase we use golden tests with the `accept` test option turned on.
-- Here we use an executable for easier customization.
