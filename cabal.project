-- Needs a newer base so won't work on 8.10, various dependencies of coq don't work
-- when cross building for windows
if impl(ghc < 9.0) || os(windows)
  -- Note: we enable this and then disable it conditionally, rather than enabling
  -- it conditionally, to abvoid https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/9293
  package plutus-core
    flags: -with-cert
  -- This is a bit silly: although we won't use plutus-cert in this case, cabal
  -- stil considers it a "local" project and tries to solve for it. So we hack
  -- around the dependency issue so that cabal is happy, which is fine since it
  -- won't actually build it.
