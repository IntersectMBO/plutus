-- | Machinery defined in this module allows to export mulptiple Plutus Core definitions
-- (types and terms) as a single value which enables convenient testing of various procedures
-- (pretty-printing, type checking, etc): each time a function / data type is added to that value,
-- none of the tests is required to be adapted, instead all the tests see the new definition
-- automatically.

-- tests (pretty-printing, type synthesis, etc) against simple and compound modules uniformly.
