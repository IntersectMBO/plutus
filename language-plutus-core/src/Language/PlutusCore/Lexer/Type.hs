{- Note [sizeOfInteger]
The 'sizeOfInteger' built-in is a later addition. The main motivation for adding it is that it
allows to pass fewer singleton sizes around. However less boilerplate is not the only advantage,
'sizeOfInteger' also allows to treat built-in functions and user-defined ones similarly.
Consider the 'addInteger' built-in: it has the following type signature (PLCish pseudocode):

    addInteger : forall s. integer s -> integer s -> integer s

We know that @integer s@ determines the @s@ and hence do not require an additional singleton size.
We could have @succInteger@ with a similar type signature:

    succInteger : forall s. integer s -> integer s

However without 'sizeOfInteger' we can't define 'succInteger' inside the language without requiring
an additional singleton size. A previous definition without 'sizeOfInteger':

    /\(s :: size) -> \(ss : size s) (i : integer s) ->
        addInteger {s} i (resizeInteger {1} {s} ss 1!1)

So we have this metaknowledge that @integer s@ determines the @s@, but without an additional primitive
cannot communicate this to Plutus Core and pay by passing a lot of sizes around. The current definition:

    /\(s :: size) -> \(i : integer s) ->
        addInteger {s} i (resizeInteger {1} {s} (sizeOfInteger {s} i) 1!1)

which has the desired type signature:

    succInteger : forall s. integer s -> integer s
