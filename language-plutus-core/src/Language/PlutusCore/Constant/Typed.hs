{- Note [DynamicBuiltinNameMeaning]
We represent the meaning of a 'DynamicBuiltinName' as a 'TypeScheme' and a Haskell denotation.
We need both while evaluting a 'DynamicBuiltinName', because 'TypeScheme' is required for
well-typedness to avoid using 'unsafeCoerce' and similar junk, while the denotation is what
actually computes. We do not need denotations for type checking, nor strongly typed 'TypeScheme'
is required, however analogously to static built-ins, we compute the types of dynamic built-ins from
their 'TypeScheme's. This way we only define a 'TypeScheme', which we anyway need, and then compute
the corresponding 'Type' from it. And we can't go the other way around -- from untyped to typed --
of course. Therefore a typed thing has to go before the corresponding untyped thing and in the
final pipeline one has to supply a 'DynamicBuiltinNameMeaning' for each of the 'DynamicBuiltinName's.

{- Note [Semantics of dynamic built-in types]
We only allow dynamic built-in types that

1. can be represented using static types in PLC. For example Haskell's 'Char' can be represented as
@integer@ in PLC. This restriction makes the dynamic built-in types machinery somewhat similar to
type aliases in Haskell (defined via the @type@ keyword). The reason for this restriction is that
storing values of arbitrary types of a host language in the AST of a target language is commonly far
from being trivial, hence we do not support this right now, but we plan to figure out a way to allow
such extensions to the AST
2. are of kind @*@. Dynamic built-in types that are not of kind @*@ can be encoded via recursive
instances. For example:

    instance KnownType a => KnownType [a] where
        ...

The meaning of a free type variable is 'OpaqueTerm'.

This is due to the fact that we use Haskell classes to assign semantics to dynamic built-in types and
since it's anyway impossible to assign a meaning to an open PLC type, because you'd have to somehow
interpret free variables, we're only interested in closed PLC types and those can be handled by
recursive instances as shown above.

Since type classes are globally coherent by design, we also have global coherence for dynamic built-in
types for free. Any dynamic built-in type means the same thing regardless of the blockchain it's
added to. It may prove to be restrictive, but it's a good property to start with, because less things
can silently stab you in the back.

An @KnownType a@ instance provides

1. a way to encode @a@ as a PLC type ('toTypeAst')
2. a function that encodes values of type @a@ as PLC terms ('makeKnown')
3. a function that decodes PLC terms back to Haskell values ('readKnown')

The last two are ought to constitute an isomorphism.
-}

{- Note [Converting PLC values to Haskell values]
The first thought that comes to mind when you asked to convert a PLC value to the corresponding Haskell
value is "just match on the AST". This works nicely for simple things like 'Char's which we encode as
@integer@s, see the @KnownType Char@ instance.

But how to convert something more complicated like lists? A PLC list gets passed as argument to
a built-in after it gets evaluated to WHNF. We can't just match on the AST here, because after
the initial lambda it can be anything there: function applications, other built-ins, recursive data,
anything. "Well, just normalize it" -- not so fast: for one, we did not have a term normalization
procedure at the moment this note was written, for two, it's not something that can be easily done,
because you have to carefully handle uniques (we generate new terms during evaluation) and perform
type substitutions, because types must be preserved.

Besides, matching on the AST becomes really complicated: you have to ensure that a term does have
an expected semantics by looking at the term's syntax. Huge pattern matches followed by multiple
checks that variables have equal names in right places and have distinct names otherwise. Making a
mistake is absolutely trivial here. Of course, one could just omit checks and hope it'll work alright,
but eventually it'll break and debugging won't be fun at all.

So instead of dealing with syntax of terms, we deal with their semantics. Namely, we evaluate terms
using some evaluator (normally, the CEK machine). For the temporary lack of ability to put values of
arbitrary Haskell types into the Plutus Core AST, we have some ad hoc strategies for converting PLC
values to Haskell values (ground, product, sum and recursive types are all handled distinctly,
see the "Language.PlutusCore.Constant.Dynamic.Instances" module).
-}

{- Note [Evaluators]
A dynamic built-in name can be applied to something that contains uninstantiated variables. There are
several possible ways to handle that:

1. each evaluator is required to perform substitutions to instantiate all variables in arguments to
built-ins. The drawback is that this can be inefficient in cases when there are many applications of
built-ins and arguments are of non-primitive types. Besides, substitution is tricky and is trivial to
screw up
2. we can break encapsulation and pass environments to the built-ins application machinery, so that it
knows how to instantiate variables. This would work for the strict CEK machine, but the lazy
CEK machine also has a heap and there can be other evaluators that have their internal state that
can't just be thrown away and it's impossible for the built-ins application machinery to handle states
of all possible evaluators beforehand
3. or we can just require to pass the current evaluator with its encapsulated state to functions that
evaluate built-in applications. The type of evaluators is this then:

    type Evaluator f m = DynamicBuiltinNameMeanings -> f TyName Name () -> m EvaluationResult

so @Evaluator Term m@ receives a map with meanings of dynamic built-in names which extends the map the
evaluator already has (this is needed, because we may add new dynamic built-in names during conversion
of PLC values to Haskell values), a 'Term' to evaluate and returns an @m EvaluationResult@.
Thus, whenever we want to resume evaluation during computation of a dynamic built-in application,
we just call the received evaluator

(3) seems best, so it's what is implemented.

Having a dynamic built-in with the following signature:

that maps to Haskell's

    reverse :: forall a. [a] -> [a]

evaluation of

    PLC.reverse {bool} (cons true (cons false nil))

proceeds as follows:

      PLC.reverse {bool} (cons true (cons false nil))
    ~ makeKnown (Haskell.reverse (readKnown (cons true (cons false nil))))
    ~ makeKnown (Haskell.reverse [OpaqueTerm true, OpaqueTerm false])
    ~ makeKnown [OpaqueTerm false, OpaqueTerm true]
    ~ cons false (cons true nil)

Note how we use 'OpaqueTerm' in order to wrap a PLC term as a Haskell value using 'readKnown' and
then unwrap the term back using 'makeKnown' without ever inspecting the term.
