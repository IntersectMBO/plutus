{- Note [DynamicBuiltinNameMeaning]
We represent the meaning of a 'DynamicBuiltinName' as a 'TypeScheme' and a Haskell denotation.
We need both while evaluting a 'DynamicBuiltinName', because 'TypeScheme' is required for
well-typedness to avoid using 'unsafeCoerce' and similar junk, while the denotation is what
actually computes. We do not need denotations for type checking, nor strongly typed 'TypeScheme'
is required, however analogously to static built-ins, we compute the types of dynamic built-ins from
their 'TypeScheme's. This way we only define a 'TypeScheme', which we anyway need, and then compute
the corresponding 'Type' from it. And we can't go the other way around -- from untyped to typed --
of course. Therefore a typed thing has to go before the corresponding untyped thing and in the
final pipeline one has to supply a 'DynamicBuiltinNameMeaning' for each of the 'DynamicBuiltinName's.

{- Note [Motivation for polymorphic built-in functions]
We need to support polymorphism for built-in functions for these reasons:

1. @ifThenElse@ for 'Bool' (being a built-in type rather than a Scott-encoded one) has to be
   polymorphic as its type signature is

       ifThenElse : all a. Bool -> a -> a -> a

   Previously we had 'Bool' as a Scott-encoded type, but this required plenty of supporting machinery,
   because unlifting (aka Scott-decoding) a PLC 'Bool' into a Haskell 'Bool' is quite a non-trivial
   thing, see https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/blob/e222466e6d46bbca9f76243bb496b3c88ed02ca1/language-plutus-core/src/Language/PlutusCore/Constant/Typed.hs#L165-L252

   Now that we got rid of all this complexity we have to pay for that by supporting polymorphic
   built-in functions (but we added that support long ago anyway, 'cause it was easy to do).

2. we may want to add efficient polymorphic built-in types like @IntMap@ or @Vector@ and most functions
   defined over them are polymorphic as well
-}

{- Note [Implemetation of polymorphic built-in functions]
Encoding polymorphism in an AST in an intrinsically typed manner is not a pleasant thing to do in Haskell.
It's not impossible, see "Embedding F", Sam Lindley: http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/slindley/papers/embedding-f.pdf
But we'd rather avoid such heavy techniques.

Fortunately, there is a simple trick: we have parametricity in Haskell, so a function that is
polymorphic in its argument can't inspect that argument in any way and so we never actually need to
convert such an argument from PLC to Haskell just to convert it back later without ever inspecting
the value. Instead we can keep the argument intact and apply the Haskell function directly to
the PLC AST representing some value.

E.g. Having a built-in function with the following signature (assuming we somehow have a PLC @list@
mapping to Haskell @[]@ -- that was possible before, but not now, but the example is still instructive):

    reverse : all a. list a -> list a

that maps to Haskell's

    reverse :: forall a. [a] -> [a]

evaluation of

    PLC.reverse {bool} (cons true (cons false nil))

proceeds as follows:

      PLC.reverse {bool} (cons true (cons false nil))
    ~ makeKnown (Haskell.reverse (readKnown (cons true (cons false nil))))
    ~ makeKnown (Haskell.reverse [Opaque true, Opaque false])
    ~ makeKnown [Opaque false, Opaque true]
    ~ EvaluationSuccess (cons false (cons true nil))

Note how we use the 'Opaque' wrapper in order to unlift a PLC term as an opaque Haskell value
using 'readKnown' and then lift the term back using 'makeKnown' without ever inspecting the term.

@Opaque term rep@ can be used for passing any @term@ through the builtin application machinery,
not just one whose type is a bound variable. For example, you can define a new data type

    data NatRep

provide a 'KnownTypeAst' instance for it (mapping a @Proxy NatRep@ to the actual type of natural
numbers in PLC) and define a (rather pointless) builtin like @idNat : nat -> nat@.

It's also possible to bind a type variable of a higher-kind, say, @f :: * -> *@ and make a builtin
with the following signature:

    idFInteger : all (f :: * -> *). f integer -> f integer

where the type application is handled with 'TyAppRep'

It would be much better if we didn't need to define that @*Rep@ stuff at the type level just to
demote it to the term level via a type class, but this hasn't been investigated yet. A plausible
way would be to ditch 'KnownTypeAst' (but keep 'KnownType') and provide PLC types manually.
But that doesn't seem to give rise to a terribly nice API.

The implementation is rather straightforward, but there is one catch, namely that it takes some care
to adapt the CEK machine to handle polymorphic built-in functions,
see https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/issues/1882

{- Note [KnownType's defaults]
We use @default@ for providing instances for built-in types instead of @DerivingVia@,
because the latter breaks on

    1. proxy a
    2. m a

It's possible to circumvent this, by using

    1. Proxy a
    2. forall r. (a -> m r) -> m r

instead, but then we need to recover the original handy definitions and
make the API and the code bloated (instances are more verbose with @DerivingVia@).
