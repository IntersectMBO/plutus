{- Note [Interpretation of names]
The thing about dynamic built-in names is that they really can denote arbitrary effects.
This means we can't just initialize an evaluator with a 'DynamicBuiltinNameMeanings', because
some of these 'DynamicBuiltinNameMeaning's may be initializable in monads, some of them may call
effectful functions during evaluation (but we use 'unsafePerformIO' to handle this case for now),
but what's worse is that some of them may require finalization. This means we can't even pass a
@m DynamicBuiltinNameMeaning@ to an evaluator, we have to do something *after* evaluation finishes.
And of course the evaluator can't know everything we may want to do. In general, we want a way to
interpret dynamic built-in names in such a way that intepretation alters the process of evaluation.
Like if you want logging, then you need to open something to write logs in before evaluation starts
and to read the logs after evaluation finishes. But it is also the case that many dynamic built-in
names are perfectly pure, so we need an interface that allows to compose various kinds of handlers
of dynamic built-in names. And "handler" is a very right word, because what we do in this file is
very similar to how handlers of algebraic effects work.
-}

{- Note [Names at the type-level]
Due to the fact that the interpretation of a dynamic built-in name is an arbitrary effect, we must know
beforehand names that a term contains, because the type of the result of evaluation depends on them.
An on-chain evaluator knows how to evaluate certain names, but terms are generated off-chain meaning
the on-chain evaluator and the off-chain generator must have consensus on which names what mean.
For this reason we index an on-chain term by a list of dynamic built-in names it can contain.
Any generator targeting a certain blockchain must produce terms indexed by names the blockchain is able
to evaluate.
