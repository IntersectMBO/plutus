{- Note [Sequencing]
WARNING: it is not allowed to call 'eval' or @readKnown eval@ over a term that already
was 'eval'ed. It may be temptive to preevaluate to WHNF some term if you later need to evaluate
its several instantiations, but it is forbidden to do so. The reason for this restriction is that
'eval' encapsulates its internal state and the state gets updated during evaluation, so if you
try to call 'eval' over something that already was 'eval'ed, that second 'eval' won't have the
updated state that the first 'eval' finished with. This may cause all kinds of weird error messages,
for example, an error message saying that there is a free variable and evaluation cannot proceed.
