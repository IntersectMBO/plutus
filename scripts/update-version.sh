# Update version bounds in all cabal files
# It looks for patterns like the following:
#
# - ", plutus-core"
# - ", plutus-core:uplc"
# - ", plutus-core ^>=1.0"
# - ", plutus-core:{plutus-core, plutus-core-testlib}  ^>=1.0"
#
# and updates the version bounds to "^>={major version}"
#
# The ?* pattern prevents 'find' from attempting to modify ".cabal" (no basename).
#
# The pattern $PACKAGE[^-A-Za-z0-1][^^] matches the package name followed by the rest of the
# line up to but not including the first ^ (if any); anything after that is replaced with the
# new bound. We need [^-A-Za-z0-1] to exactly match the name of the package whose bounds we
# want to update and make sure that we don't get a situation like `plutus-tx` matching
# `plutus-tx-plugin`.
#
# The second sed command is to match the case where the package name is at the end of the line:
# we need this because the first case requires at least one character after the package name.
#
# Note that this all requires a comma (maybe preceded and/or followed by whitespace) at the
# start of the line: it won't work with a comma at the end.
