# ci-plutus-benchmark: Run benchmarks on 2 branches, compare the results and
# add a comment on the corresponding PR on GitHub.
#
# This script is supposed to be executed by https://buildkite.com/input-output-hk/plutus-benchmark
# which itself is triggered through the GitHub workflow ./.github/workflows/benchmark.yaml
#
# USAGE: 
# In order to trigger benchmarking for an open PR, add `/benchmark` as a comment to
# the PR. The command will be acknowledged with a :rocket: reaction and when done a bot will
# add the results as comment to the same PR.
#
# NOTES:
# (1) In order to post a comment to GitHub the buildkite runner needs to provide a
#     GitHub token with permissions to add comments in '/run/keys/buildkite-github-token'
#     otherwise this will fail.
# (2) The `cabal update` command below is neccessary because while the whole script
#     is executed inside a nix-shell, this environment does not provide the hackage
#     record inside .cabal and we have to fetch/build this each time since we want
#     to run this in a clean environment.
# (3) The `jq` invocation below is necessary because we have to POST the PR comment
#     as JSON data (see the curl command) meaning the script output has to be escaped
#     first before we can insert it.
