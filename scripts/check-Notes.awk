# Notes

# The Plutus codebase contains a large number comments and the more important ones are in the form
# of Notes which have titles that can be referenced from elsewhere (this idea is taken from GHC).
# In order to make these easy to search and cross-reference we enforce a number of conventions,
# which are as follows.


# * Notes are comments beginning with `{- Note [<title>]` or `-- Note [<title>]`.  The
#   `{-` form is preferred, and a space is required before "Note".
#
# * A reference to a Note is of the form `Note [<title>]`.
#
# * The title of a note can be any sequence of printable characters, excluding ']' but
#  including spaces
#
# * In both definitions and references any (nonzero) number of spaces is allowed
#   before "Note" and between "Note" and "[".
#
# * No characters except spaces are allowed between "Note" and "["; in particular
#  `Note: [...]` is prohibited.
#
# * References must refer to the exact title of the relevant Note, including spaces and
#   capitalisation.
#
# * No two Notes should have the same title.
#
# * All references must refer to Notes which are defined somewhere in the codebase.
#
# * In definitions the title is allowed to contain line breaks but there must be
#   no line breaks between the start of the comment and "Note" or between "Note"
#   and "[".
#
# * In references, line breaks are allowed in the title and after "Note".  This
#   is allowed because code formatters may insert line breaks in these positions
#   automatically.
#
# * `NOTE [` and `note [` are not allowed in either definitions or references.
#
# * Definitions of Notes must be ordinary comments: Haddock comments are not allowed.
#
# * Plural references are not allowed: "See Notes [A], [B], and [C]" is
#   prohibited.  To avoid this, use a single reference to each note: "See Note
#   [A], Note [B], and Note [C]".


# This script scans a set of files whose names are supplied on the command line and will report most
# violations of the conventions.  Set `longOutput` to a non-zero value to get more information about
# the location of the problems (or use the `-l` option in the shell script which invokes the Awk
# code).

# The script is not foolproof.  For example, block comments with `--` can be problematic: an unlucky
# line break after "See" can leave `-- Note [...]` at the start of a line and it's difficult to tell
# automatically that that's not the start of a new Note.  Similarly, references to a Note in a block
# comment to the right of a block of code may confuse the script if there is a line break in the
# title, since a linear scan of the file will interpose some of the source code in the title.

# The script makes no attempt to distinguish between code and comments.  A Haskell program could
# contain `Note [1,2,3]` as a legitimate expression and the script will treat this as a reference to
# a Note.  A similar situation could also occur in a quoted string.

# Note also that if there are multiple references to "Note [XYZ]" and there's no such note then the
# script will only report one reference; it will be necessary to re-run the script to check for
# further references.

# This function looks for "Note [...]" and extracts everything between the parentheses.  It will
# work even if the two parentheses are on different lines and will modify $0 so that it starts just
# after the closing parenthesis, enabling further processing.  It will not work if "Note" is at the
# end of a line and "[" is on the next line, but later code takes care of the case when this occurs
# in a reference.  Line breaks in the title are replaced with single spaces.
