-------------------------------------------------
-- On-Chain Loan Validator
-------------------------------------------------
-- | The purpose of this validator is to guarantee that loan negotiations and repayment go
-- smoothly without needing to trust the other party.
--
-- This validator uses the presence or absence of the beacon tokens to judge the validity of
-- the datums. This is due to the beacon tokens only being mintable when the datums are valid.
--
-- If there is ever a datum present WITHOUT the proper beacon token, the staking credential of
-- the address has custody rights. This is to protect the address owner from malicious datums.
-- It is therefore up to the lenders to ensure proper usage of this validator.
--
-- It is technically possible for a malicious user to create their own beacon minting policy for use
-- with this validator. However, this would be an entirely different token than the actual beacons
-- which means they would not even be discoverable by other users.
--
-- Since the active utxo is time-locked for the borrower, there is no need to ensure that ONLY the
-- collateral assets ever leave. Those assets come from the borrower and the borrower has custody
-- of that utxo until the loan expires.
--
-- There are no checks to ensure that the borrower only takes the proper assets from the offer
-- utxo. Instead, it is up to the lender to ONLY deposit the assets that are to be loaned out.
-- This does not seem like an unreasonable expectation.
--
-- The beacon policy requires that the beacons can only be minted to an address with a staking
-- pubkey. However, there is no way to enforce this from the validator's side which means it is
-- possible to send funds to an address instance for this validator that uses a staking script.
-- Note that it would be impossible to actually broadcast this address with the beacons. However,
-- the funds would be permanently locked unless the validator allowed spending with a staking script
-- as well as a staking pubkey. To prevent this locking, the validator still checks if the staking
-- script signals approval, too.
--
-- The interest for these loans is non-compounding.
