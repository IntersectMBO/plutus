This directory contains Plutus implementations of insertion sort, merge sort,
and quicksort.  The `list-sort-exe` executable runs these with worst-case inputs
of increasing length and prints out some statistics (cost and number of CEK
steps) and the `list-sort` benchmark contains Criterion benchmarks to get actual
times.
