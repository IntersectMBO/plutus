{- | Benchmarks based on validations obtained using
plutus-use-cases:plutus-use-cases-scripts, which runs various contracts on the
blockchain simulator and dumps the applied validators as flat-encoded
scripts. Generating these scripts is a very lengthy process involving building a
lot of code, so the scripts were generated once and copied to the 'data'
directory here.  Type 'cabal run plutus-use-cases:plutus-use-cases-scripts
plutus-benchmark/validation/data scripts' in the root directory of the Plutus
repository to regenerate them, but *be careful*. It's possible that the name of
the files may change and you could be left with old files that still get
benchmarked, so it might be a good idea to remove the old ones first (and
remember that these are all checked in to git).  Also, the compiler output may
have changed since he scripts were last generated and so the builtins used and
so on could be different, which may confuse benchmark comparisons.  We might
want to have two sets of benchmarks: one for a set of fixed scripts that let us
benchmark the evaluator independently of other factors, and another which is
generated anew every time to allow us to measure changes in the entire
compilation/execution pipeline.

NB. Running these benchmarks with `stack bench` will use copies of the scripts
in `.stack_work` (and accessed via Paths_plutus_benchmark), and if a file in
`data` is removed and the benchmarks are re-run, the benchmarking code may still
be able to access the old copy in stack's files.  --}

{- Note also that this directory (and any subdirectories) must be included in the
   "data-files" section of the cabal file to ensure that Paths_plutus_benchmark
   still works. -}
