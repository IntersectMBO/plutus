for each data/*.flat validation script, it benchmarks
the whole time taken from script deserialization to script execution result.

 Run the benchmarks.  You can run groups of benchmarks by typing things like
     `stack bench -- plutus-benchmark:validation-full --ba crowdfunding`
   or
     `cabal bench -- plutus-benchmark:validation-full --benchmark-options crowdfunding`.
