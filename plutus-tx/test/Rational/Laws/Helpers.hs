-- This is a hack to avoid coverage issues.
--
-- Consider the symmetry property of a binary relation R. This states that, if x
-- R y, then y R x; notably, if some x and y are not related by R, we don't
-- really mind if y and x are related by R or not.
--
-- Consider testing the symmetry of equality. If we do so naively, we generate x
-- and y independently of one another; if the type of x and y has either a
-- large, or _infinite_, number of inhabitants, the probability that we generate
-- equal x and y is low. Therefore, a naive test based on the symmetry property
-- would pass, but _not_ because of the relation: instead, it would pass because
-- the 'precondition' holds too rarely to possibly ever come up!
--
-- This function takes the provided generator, and uses it to generate two
-- inputs to the supplied function; however, it ensures that roughly half the
-- time, it will generate two copies of the same value, rather than two
-- independent values. This ensures that we avoid the above problem.
--
-- Important note: this assumes that the binary relation under test is also
-- reflexive, and that the type of the generated values is either large or
-- infinite. If one or both of these don't hold, use of this function will have
-- the _opposite_ effect, as it will skew the test outcomes.

-- This is the same as 'testEntangled', but for three values instead of two.
-- More precisely, this ensures that, given a generator and function argument,
-- that roughly half the time, the function argument is called with three copies

-- All the caveats of 'testEntangled' also apply to this function.

-- Hedgehog treats coverage as an absolute minimum: more precisely, given N
-- tests to run and a coverage target of M%, Hedgehog will run N tests, and
-- check if at least M% of them fit the condition specified.
--
-- Given that cases are generated pseudorandomly, there is always a chance of
-- 'probabilistic swing', which might be small (for example, < 1%). However,
-- Hedgehog does _not_ take this into account: _any_ shortfall from the stated
-- coverage requirements is seen as a coverage failure, whether it's 10% or
-- 0.1%.
--
-- The only way to control this behaviour is to massively increase the number of
-- tests, and rely on the law of expected values to kick in. This wrapper does
-- so in a way that doesn't require passing magical arguments around, and also
-- allows easier tweaking.

-- 'CoGen' is used in function testing, which permits the generation of

-- We do this here by deferring to (Integer, Integer): essentially, we specify

-- value generation is affected.
