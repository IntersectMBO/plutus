### Changed

- The type of `writeBits` built-in PlutusTx/Plinth function has been changed from

```
BuiltinByteString ->  [Integer] ->  [Bool] ->  BuiltinByteString
```

to

```
BuiltinByteString ->  [Integer] ->  Bool ->  BuiltinByteString
```

Instead of a list of boolean values to write to bit positions specified in the
second argument it now takes a single boolean value which is used to update the
bits at all of the given positions.  If it's necessary to set some bits and
clear others then the function should be called twice, once with `True` as the
third argument and once with `False`.
