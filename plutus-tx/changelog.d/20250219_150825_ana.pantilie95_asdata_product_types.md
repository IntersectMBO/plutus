### Changed

- `AsData` for product types now generates code with better performance.
- This code is more susceptible to strictness changes, therefore, when dealing with such types, we highly recommend using pattern matching for extracting fields instead of using the field accessor functions. As an example, see the modification in `plutus-benchmark/script-contexts/src/PlutusBenchmark/V3/Data/ScriptContexts.hs`.
