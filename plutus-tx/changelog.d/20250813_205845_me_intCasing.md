### Added

- Added Plinth builtin `caseInteger :: forall a. Integer -> [a] -> a`. Which will generate `Case` node that will case with the given integer as scrutinee and list as branches. This function expects it's second argument to be the Haskell list constructors. For example, `caseInteger 1 [1, 2, 3, 4]` will work, but `caseInteger 1 (id [1, 2, 3, 4])` won't work because the second argument is not a Haskell list constructor.
