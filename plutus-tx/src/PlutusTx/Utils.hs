{- Note [The Delay type]
Occasionally we need to explicitly delay evaluation of an expression, since PLC
is strict. Ideally, this would eventually translate into the underlying 'delay'
and 'force' constructors of UPLC, as this is the fastest way to do it.

Our typed intermediate languages do not have 'delay' and 'force', however.
What they do have is type abstractions and type instantiations, which get
compiled into 'delay' and 'force', respectively. So what we want is something
which will create a (needless) type abstraction/type instantiation.

This is what 'Delay' does: the constructor accepts a 'forall' type, so the
expression inside the constructor application should be a type abstraction;
and 'force' just instantiates this to an arbitrary type, in this case
'BuiltinUnit'.
