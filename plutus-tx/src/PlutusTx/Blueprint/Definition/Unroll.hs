-- Functionality to "unroll" types. -- For more context see the note ["Unrolling" types] -----------

{- Note ["Unrolling" types]

ContractBlueprint needs to be parameterized by a list of types used in
a contract's type signature (including nested types) in order to:
  a) produce a JSON-schema definition for every type used.
  b) ensure that the schema definitions are referenced in a type-safe way.

Given the following contract validator's type signature:

  typedValidator :: Redeemer -> Datum -> ScriptContext -> Bool

and the following data type definitions:

  data Redeemer = MkRedeemer MyStruct
  data MyStruct = MkMyStruct { field1 :: Integer, field2 :: Bool }
  type Datum = ()

The ContractBlueprint type should be:

  ContractBlueprint '[Redeemer, MyStruct, Integer, Bool, ()]

However, for contract blurprints authors specifying all the nested types manually is
cumbersome and error-prone. To make it easier to work with, we provide the Unroll type family
that can be used to traverse a type accumulating all types nested within it:

  Unroll Redeemer ~ '[Redeemer, MyStruct, Integer, Bool]
  UnrollAll '[Redeemer, Datum] ~ '[Redeemer, MyStruct, Integer, Bool, ()]

This way blueprint authors can specify the top-level types used in a contract and the UnrollAll
type family will take care of discovering all the nested types:

  Blueprint '[Redeemer, Datum]

  is equivalent to

  ContractBlueprint '[Redeemer, MyStruct, Integer, Bool, ()]

{- | Unroll a type into a list of all nested types (including the type itself).

  If a type doesn't have a generic representation, then this type family gets "stuck".
  The good news is that for the purpose of deriving schema definitions, we only need to
  consider types that are either end-user defined (and therefore have a generic representation) or
  built-in types that we explicitly list here as terminals in order not to get "stuck".
