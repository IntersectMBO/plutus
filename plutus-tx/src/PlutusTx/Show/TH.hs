{- | Currently the only way to concatenate `BuiltinString`s is `appendString`, whose cost
 is linear in the total length of the two strings. A naive concatenation of multiple
 `BuiltinString`s costs @O(n^2)@ in the worst case, where @n@ is the total length. By
 collecting the `BuiltinString`s in a list and concatenating them in the end, the cost
 can be reduced to @O(n*logn)@. If we add a @concatStrings@ builtin function in the future,
 the cost can be further reduced to @O(n)@.

 Like `GHC.Show.ShowS`, the purpose of the function type here is to turn list concatenation
 into function composition.
