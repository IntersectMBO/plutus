-- This instance ensures that we can apply typeable type constructors to typeable arguments and get a typeable
-- type. We need the kind variable, so that partial application of type constructors works.

{- Note [Typeable instances for function types]
Surely there is an obvious 'Typeable' instance for 'a -> b': we just turn it directly
into a 'TyFun'!

However, if you write this instance, you find that it overlaps with the instance for applied
type constructors. For is not '(->) a' an applied type constructor?

Vexing. However, if we run with this, we can define a 'Typeable' instance for '(->)' directly.
What is this? Well, it's something like '\a b . a -> b' as a type function. Which is a rather
silly thing to write, but it does work.
