{- Note [Compiling at TH time and runtime]
We want to reuse PIR's machinery for defining datatypes. However, one cannot
get a PLC Type consisting of the compiled PIR type, because the compilation of the
definitions is done by making a *term*.

So we use the abstract support for handling definitions in PIR, MonadDefs. Typeable
then has `typeRep :: Proxy a -> RTCompile uni fun (Type TyName uni ())`,
which says that you can get the type in some compilation monad (which
you will later have to discharge yourself).

This means that the TH expressions we are generating are not for `Type`s directly, but rather
for monadic expressions that will, at runtime, compute types. We are effectively generating
a specialized compiler.

We thus have two pieces of compilation going on here:
- At TH time, we reify information about datatypes, and construct specialized compilation expressions
  for the various parts.
- At runtime, we actually run these and create definitions etc.

The interplay between the parts happening at TH time and the parts happening at runtime is somewhat
awkward, but I couldn't think of a better way of doing it.

A particularly awkward feature is that the typeclass constraints required by the code in each
instance are going to be different, and so we can't use reusable functions, instead we need to
inline all the definitions so that the overall expression can have the right constraints inferred.

{- Note [Typeable instances for function types]
Surely there is an obvious 'Typeable' instance for 'a -> b': we just turn it directly
into a 'TyFun'!

However, if you write this instance, you find that it overlaps with the instance for applied
type constructors. For is not '(->) a' an applied type constructor?

Vexing. However, if we run with this, we can define a 'Typeable' instance for '(->)' directly.
What is this? Well, it's something like '\a b . a -> b' as a type function. Which is a rather
silly thing to write, but it does work.
