{- Note [GHC.Magic.noinline]
For some functions we have two conflicting desires:
- We want to have the unfolding available for the plugin.
- We don't want the function to *actually* get inlined before the plugin runs, since we rely
on being able to see the original function for some reason.

'INLINABLE' achieves the first, but may cause the function to be inlined too soon.

We can solve this at specific call sites by using the 'noinline' magic function from
GHC. This stops GHC from inlining it. As a bonus, it also won't be inlined if
that function is compiled later into the body of another function.

We do therefore need to handle 'noinline' in the plugin, as it itself does not have
an unfolding.

{- Note [Built-in types and their Haskell counterparts]
'HasToBuiltin' allows us to convert a value of a built-in type such as 'ByteString' to its Plutus
Tx counterpart, 'BuiltinByteString' in this case. The idea is the same for all built-in types: just
take the Haskell version and make it the Plutus Tx one.

'HasToOpaque' is different, we use it for converting values of only those built-in types that exist
in the Plutus Tx realm, within the Plutus Tx realm. I.e. we cannot convert a 'ByteString', since
'ByteString's don't exist in Plutus Tx, only 'BuiltinByteString's do.

Consider, say, the built-in pair type. In Plutus Tx, we have an (opaque) type for this. It's opaque
because you can't actually pattern match on it, instead you can only in fact use the specific
functions that are available as builtins.

We _also_ have the normal Haskell pair type. This is very different: you can pattern match on it,
and you can use whatever user-defined functions you like on it.

Users would really like to use the latter, and not the former. So we often want to _wrap_ our
built-in functions with little adapters that convert between the opaque "version" of a
type and the "normal Haskell" "version" of a type.

This is what the 'HasToOpaque' and 'HasFromOpaque' classes do. They let us write wrappers for
builtins relatively consistently by just calling 'toOpaque' on their arguments and 'fromOpaque' on
the result. They shouldn't probably be used otherwise.

Ideally, we would not have instances for types which don't have a different Haskell representation
type, such as 'Integer'. 'Integer' in Plutus Tx user code _is_ the opaque built-in type, we don't
expose a different one. So there's no conversion to do. However, this interacts badly with the
instances for polymorphic built-in types, which also convert the type _inside_ them. (This is
necessary to avoid doing multiple traversals of the type, e.g. we don't want to turn a built-in list
into a Haskell list, and then traverse it again to conver the contents). Then we _need_ instances
for all built-in types, so we provide a @default@ implementation for both 'toOpaque' and
'fromOpaque' that simply returns the argument back and use it for those types that don't require any
conversions.

Summarizing, 'toBuiltin'/'fromBuiltin' should be used to cross the boundary between Plutus Tx and
Haskell, while 'toOpaque'/'fromOpaque' should be used within Plutus Tx to convert values to/from
their @Builtin*@ representation, which we need because neither pattern matching nor standard library
functions are available for values of @Builtin*@ types that we get from built-in functions.
-}

{- Note [HasFromOpaque/HasToOpaque instances for polymorphic builtin types]
For various technical reasons
(see Note [Representable built-in functions over polymorphic built-in types])
it's not always easy to provide polymorphic constructors for built-in types, but we can usually
provide destructors.

What this means in practice is that we can write a generic 'HasFromOpaque' instance for pairs that
makes use of polymorphic @fst@/@snd@ builtins, but we can't write a polymorphic 'ToOpaque' instance
because we'd need a polymorphic version of the '(,)' constructor.

Instead we write monomorphic instances corresponding to monomorphic constructor builtins that we add
for specific purposes.
-}

{- Note [Fundeps versus type families in HasFromOpaque/HasToOpaque]
We could use a type family here to get the builtin representation of a type. After all, it's
entirely determined by the Haskell type.

However, this is harder for the plugin to deal with. It's okay to have a type variable for the
representation type that needs to be instantiated later, but it's *not* okay to have an irreducible
type application on a type variable. So fundeps are much nicer here.

{- Note [Strict conversions to/from unit]
Converting to/from unit *should* be straightforward: just `const ()`.
*But* GHC is very good at optimizing this, and we sometimes use unit
where side effects matter, e.g. as the result of `trace`. So GHC will
tend to turn `fromOpaque (trace s)` into `()`, which is wrong.

So we want our conversions to/from unit to be strict in Haskell. This
means we need to case pointlessly on the argument, which means we need
case on unit (`chooseUnit`) as a builtin. But then it all works okay.
