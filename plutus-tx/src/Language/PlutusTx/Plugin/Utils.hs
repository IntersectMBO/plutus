{- Note [plc and Proxy]
It would be nice to use TypeApplications instead of passing a Proxy to plc.
However, this means we need to create a type application in the TH-generated code which calls it.
As of recent versions of GHC, this causes an error in the module where the splice appears if it
doesn't have TypeApplications enabled.

Generally we want to avoid forcing users to enable language extensions, so we use
a Proxy to avoid this.
