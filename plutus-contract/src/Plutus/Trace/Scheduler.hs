{-

Implements a scheduler for cooperative multitasking. The scheduler supports
system calls for suspending threads, sending messages to other threads, and
starting new threads. Threads have a priority (see note [Thread Priority]).
They can send and receive messages of a user-defined type. The scheduler is
implemented as handler of the 'Control.Monad.Freer.Coroutine.Yield' effect, and
threads are @freer-simple@ programs that use that effect.

{- Note [Thread Tag]

Within the scheduler, threads are identified by their 'ThreadId'. The thread
ID is assigned at runtime when a new thread is started. So the thread ID
depends on the state of the scheduler at the time the thread is started.

This makes it hard to refer to individual threads outside of the scheduler,
for example, when we inspect the emulator log. To make it easier to find
threads later on in the log, each thread also has a user-defined tag. The
scheduler maintains a map of tags to thread IDs, so that we can send messages
to threads that we only know the tag of.

It is up to the user to ensure that tags are unique. If two threads have the
same tag, the functioning of the scheduler is not affected (each thread still
has its own mailbox), but the tag can no longer be used to uniquely identify a
thread. In practice however the number of interesting threads is small enough
that finding distinct tags for them is not a problem.

    deriving anyclass (Hashable, ToJSON, FromJSON)
    deriving Pretty via (Tagged "Thread" Int)

-- | ID of the first thread.
initialThreadId :: ThreadId
initialThreadId = ThreadId 0

{- Note [Thread Priority]

When a thread yields control it assigns itself one of three priorities. The
priority determines how long the thread goes to sleep for. The scheduler
maintains one queue of suspended threads for each priority.

In the emulator, we use thread priorities to drive the progress of simulated
time. See note [Simulator Time] in 'Plutus.Trace.Emulator.System' for details.

-}

{- Note [Freeze and Thaw]

Freezing and unfreezing use two slightly different mechanims.

To freeze a thread, that thread must suspend itself with the 'Frozen' priority.
If we want to be able to freeze a thread from the outside, we need to send it a
message instructing it to do so. (In the emulator, this is the 'Freeze'
constructor of 'Plutus.Trace.Emulator.Types.EmulatorMessage'.)

@
  mkSysCall @_ @EmulatorMessage Normal (Message threadId Freeze)
@


To unfreeze a thread, we use the 'Thaw' system call of the emulator.

@
  mkSysCall @_ @systemEvent Normal (Thaw threadId)
@

Note how the sytem event type in the first line is instantiated to
'EmulatorMessage', and in the second line it is free. The goal of this
somewhat roundabout approach is to avoid having to fish out the thread from the
queues of the scheduler state. Instead, we tell the thread to freeze itself, so
we don't have to mess with the queues.
