-- $contractstate
-- Types for initialising and running instances of 'Contract's. The types and
-- functions in this module are convenient wrappers around types and functions
-- from 'Language.Plutus.Contract.Types', exposing an interface that is suitable
-- for consumption by the PAB. In particular this means that
-- 'insertAndUpdateContract' has a single argument, and its argument & return
-- types can be serialised to JSON easily.
--
-- To actually run a contract, follow this workflow:
--
-- 1. Call 'initialiseContract' to get the initial 'ContractResponse'.
-- 2. Look at the 'hooks' of this value and generate an answer to one of them.
--    This answer is a 'Response' @s@ value.
-- 3. Call 'insertAndUpdateContract' with a 'ContractRequest' whose 'oldState'
--    field has the value of 'newState' of the previous response, and whose
--    'event' is the next answer (step 2).
-- 4. Take the new 'ContractResponse' and go back to step 2, until you get a
--    response with no requests, or an error.
