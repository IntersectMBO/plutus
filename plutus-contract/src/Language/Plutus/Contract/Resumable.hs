-- $resumable
-- This module defines the 'Resumable' effect and its handlers. Programs that
-- use the 'Resumable' effect can non-deterministically ask for values from the
-- environment. Non-deterministically here means that we can issue multiple
-- prompts at the same time, each with its own continuation, and continue with
-- the one that is answered first while discarding the other ones.
--
-- == Constructing resumable programs
-- Resumable programs can be constructed using 'prompt' and 'select'. 'prompt'
-- has one argument that describes the request.
--
-- >>> (prompt "A") 'select' (prompt "B")
--
-- makes two requests and returns the answer of the one that is responded to
-- first.
--
-- == Running resumable programs
-- The 'Resumable' effect is handled in two stages, using 'handleResumable' and
-- 'handleNonDetPrompt' (see note [Running resumable programs] for a description
-- of how it works). The types 'Requests' and 'Responses' store the requests
-- made by, and responses given to, a resumable program.
--
-- == 'Resumable' and non-determinism
-- The kind of non-determinism used in 'Resumable' is different from the kind
-- encoded in 'Control.Applicative.Alternative' in that it does not allow
-- for backtracking (because it's not meant to encode "searching a problem
-- space for a solution"). 'Resumable' programs do not have the ability to call
-- 'Control.Applicative.Alternative.empty' and therefore do not implement
-- the 'Control.Applicative.Alternative' class.

{- Note [Running resumable programs]

Running 'Resumable' programs involves two stages. First we transform the programs into ones that use the 'NonDet' and 'Yield' effects that come with 'freer-simple'. Then we interpret the resulting program with 'Reader' and 'State' effects to capture the state of open requests.

#### Stage 1

Stage 1 is implemented in 'handleResumable'. The result is a program that uses 'NonDet' and 'Yield' in a very specific way to implement the resumable functionality. The reason why we don't say something like 'type Resumable effs = Members '[NonDet, Yield] effs' instead of the 'Resumable' data type is that 'NonDet' allows for backtracking, which we do not want to expose to the users.

The programs produced by 'handleResumable' have at most one level of backtracking (to the next call to 'prompt'). There is no 'empty' constructor (and no 'Alternative' instance for contracts) because the only thing that can cause backtracking to happen is the provisioning of an answer to a 'prompt' call from the environment.

#### Stage 2

Stage 2 is implemented in 'handleNonDetPrompt'. Here we handle the 'Yield' and 'NonDet' effects that were introduced in the previous stage. In this stage we assign two numbers to each request issued by the contract, a 'RequestID' and an 'IterationID'. The request ID is simply a consecutive numbering of every request that is made during the lifetime of the contract. The iteration ID is unique for each group of open requests that the contract produces.

Of particular importance is the 'loop' function, which deals with the 'Status' values that we get from 'runC'. It uses the 'ResumableInterpreter' effects:

>>> type ResumableInterpreter i o effs = State IterationID ': NonDet ': State RequestID ': effs

Note that the 'IterationID' state comes before 'NonDet', and the 'RequestID' state comes after 'NonDet'. This is done so that we increase the 'RequestID' whenever a request is made, and the 'IterationID' only when a request is answered.
