{- Note [Handling state in contracts]

The 'Resumable' type encodes programs with a serialisable state that operate on
event streams. 'Resumable e (Step i o)' consumes inputs of type 'i' and produces
requests (describing the inputs that are expected next) of type 'o'. As such,
'Resumable e (Step i o)' is similar to the @Prompt i o@ type found in the
@prompt@ package.

Unlike the 'Prompt' type however, 'Resumable e (Step i o)' programs have a
builtin way of serialising their state *efficiently*: While we can always take
the state of a stream-consuming program to be the list of events it has seen so
far, we have to replay all the previous events every time a new event is
received, making the complexity of recovering the current state from the event
list quadratic.

We avoid this in 'Resumable e (Step i o)' by adding checkpoints at which the state can be serialised and resumed without having to replay all the previous
events.

The current state of 'Resumable e (Step i o)' programs is captured by the 'Record
i' type. Every 'Record' is a tree with branches that match the structure of the
'Resumable' program whose state it represents.

Given a 'Resumable e (Step i o)'  we can use 'initialise' to get the initial
'Record' that captures the state after zero events have been consumed.
'initialise' uses the writer to collect all 'o' values that describe the inputs
the progam is waiting for. When we have a new input, we call
'insertAndUpdate' with our resumable program, the previous 'Record', and the
input to get the 'Record'.

How does the checkpointing work? Note the 'CJSONCheckpoint' constructor of
'Resumable'. This constructor is used to insert a checkpoint into the resumable
program. Whenever as part of a call to 'insertAndUpdate' we encounter a
'CJSONCheckpoint n' node, we throw away the sub-tree of the old 'Record' that
contained the state of 'n', and replace it with the serialised value of the
result of 'n'. From now on, whenever we want to restore the state of
'CJSONCheckpoint' n, we use the serialised value in the 'Record', so we don't
ever need to evaluate 'n' again.

-- | 'Step i o a' is a single step in a resumable program, consuming an input
