This module defines the 'Resumable' effect and its handlers.

@Resumable i o@ programs work like state machines. Their state type is
'Requests' @o@ and their input type is 'Response' @i@. Note that the state
contains multiple requests, but the input only has a single response.
See note [Resumable state machine] for details.

== Constructing resumable programs
Resumable programs can be constructed using 'prompt' and 'select'. 'prompt'
has one argument that describes the request.

>>> (prompt "A") 'select' (prompt "B")

makes two requests and returns the answer of the one that is responded to
first. In the state machine analogy, the initial state of this program would
be the set of the two requests @"A"@ and @"B"@.

== Running resumable programs
The 'Resumable' effect is handled in two stages, using 'handleResumable' and
'handleNonDetPrompt' (see note [Running resumable programs] for a description
of how it works). The types 'Requests' and 'Responses' store the requests
made by, and responses given to, a resumable program.

== 'Resumable' and non-determinism
The kind of non-determinism used in 'Resumable' is different from the kind
encoded in 'Control.Applicative.Alternative' in that it does not allow
for backtracking (because it's not meant to encode "searching a problem
space for a solution"). 'Resumable' programs do not have the ability to call
'Control.Applicative.Alternative.empty' and therefore do not implement
the 'Control.Applicative.Alternative' class.

{- Note [Resumable state machine]

@Resumable i o@ programs are like state machines with state 'Requests' @o@ and
input 'Response' @i@. So instead of using the 'Resumable' effect we could also
write

@
    data SM i o effs = SM { currentState :: Requests o, transition :: Response i -> Eff effs (Maybe (Either a (SM i o effs)))
@

using 'Maybe' to denote the failure state and 'Either a' for the final state of
type @a@.

And this is indeed almost exactly the definition 'MultiRequestContinuation'.

We can transform an @Eff (Resumable i o ': effs)@ program into an
@Eff effs (Maybe (MultiRequestContStatus i o effs a))@ using 'handleResumable'
and 'suspendNonDet'.

{- Note [Running resumable programs]

Running 'Resumable' programs involves two stages. First we transform the programs
into ones that use the 'NonDet' and 'Yield' effects that come with
'freer-simple'. Then we interpret the resulting program with 'Reader' and
'State' effects to capture the state of open requests.

#### Stage 1

Stage 1 is implemented in 'handleResumable'. The result is a program that uses
'NonDet' and 'Yield' in a very specific way to implement the resumable
functionality. The reason why we don't say something like @type Resumable effs
= Members '[NonDet, Yield] effs@ instead of the 'Resumable' data type is that
'NonDet' allows for backtracking, which we do not want to expose to the users.

The programs produced by 'handleResumable' have at most one level of
backtracking (to the next call to 'prompt'). There is no 'empty'
constructor (and no 'Alternative' instance for contracts) because the only
thing that can cause backtracking to happen is the provisioning of an answer
to a 'prompt' call from the environment.

#### Stage 2

Stage 2 is implemented in 'suspendNonDet'. Here we handle the 'Yield' and
'NonDet' effects that were introduced in the previous stage. In this stage we
assign two numbers to each request issued by the contract, a 'RequestID' and an
'IterationID'. The request ID is simply a consecutive numbering of every
request that is made during the lifetime of the contract. The iteration ID is
unique for each group of open requests that the contract produces.

Of particular importance is the 'runStep' function, which deals with the
'Status' values that we get from 'runC'. It uses the 'ResumableEffs' effects:

>>> type ResumableEffs i o effs = State IterationID ': NonDet ': State RequestID ': effs

Note that the 'IterationID' state comes before 'NonDet', and the 'RequestID'
state comes after 'NonDet'. This is done so that we increase the 'RequestID'
whenever a request is made, and the 'IterationID' only when a request is
answered.
