=== `plutus-contract`

This package has a new API for defining "contracts": bundled applications that
interact with a wallet smart contract backend. This is in many ways the
"successor" to much of `plutus-wallet-api`, and should eventually
replace much of it.

Noteworthy modules:

* `Language.Plutus.Contract`: Exports the `Contract` type which encodes the client (off-chain) part of Plutus contracts, including blockchain queries, user-facing endpoints, and the ability to submit transactions to the ledger
* `Language.Plutus.Contract.StateMachine`: State machine client library, building on the `Contract` type and on the (mostly) on-chain code in `Language.PlutusTx.StateMachine`
* `Language.Plutus.Contract.Trace`: The `ContractTrace` type for describing sequences of emulator actions that can be used in the Playgound and in unit tests.
* `Language.Plutus.Contract.App`: Exposes a wrapper to turn `Contract` values into standalone executables, to be consumed by the SCB

It also defines the chain emulator, which is used for tests, and to back
the simulations in the Plutus Playground.
