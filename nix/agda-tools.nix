  # - The 'agda' executable
  # - The 'agda-mode' executable
  # - A 'version' attribute

  # Furthermore, the agda builder uses a `ghcWithPackages` that has to have ieee754 available.
  # We'd like it to use the same GHC as we have, if nothing else just to avoid depending on
  # another GHC from nixpkgs! Sadly, this one is harder to override, and we just hack
  # it into pkgs.haskellPackages in a fragile way. Annoyingly, this also means we have to ensure
  # we have a few extra packages that it uses in our Haskell package set.

  # Agda is a huge pain. They have a special custom setup that compiles the

  # the data files for the *library*, but they require the *executable* to
  # compile them, which depends on the library! They get away with it by
  # using the old-style builds and building everything together, we can't
  # do that.
  # So we work around it:
  # - turn off the custom setup
  # - manually compile the executable (fortunately it has no extra dependencies!)
  #   and do the compilation at the end of the library derivation.
  # In addition, depending on whether we are cross-compiling or not, the
  # compiler-nix-name handed to us by haskell.nix will be different, so we need
