== The Marlowe data types

This tutorial formally introduces Marlowe as a Haskell data type, as well as presenting
the different types used by the model, and discussing a
number of assumptions about the infrastructure in which contracts will
be run. The code that we describe here comes from the Haskell modules https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/blob/master/src/Language/Marlowe/Semantics.hs[Semantics.hs] and https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/blob/master/src/Language/Marlowe/Util.hs[Util.hs].

=== Marlowe

The Marlowe domain-specific language (DSL) is modelled as a collection of algebraic
types in Haskell, with contracts being given by the `Contract` type:

[source,haskell]
----
data Contract = Close
              | Pay AccountId Payee Token Value Contract
              | If Observation Contract Contract
              | When [Case] Timeout Contract
              | Let ValueId Value Contract
              | Assert Observation Contract
----

We saw xref:marlowe-step-by-step#marlowe-step-by-step[in the previous tutorial] what these contracts do. In the rest of this tutorial we will dig a bit deeper into the Haskell types that are used to represent the various components of the contracts, including accounts, values, observations, and actions. We will also look at types that relate to the execution of contracts, including inputs, states, the environment.

=== Basic components

In modelling basic parts of Marlowe we use a combination of Haskell `data` types, that define _new_ types, and `type` synonyms that give a new name to an existing type.footnote:[In fact we used `newtype` declarations rather than `data` types because they are more efficiently implemented.]


A Marlowe Account holds amounts of multiple currencies and/or fungible and non-fungible tokens.
A concrete amount is indexed by a `Token`, which is a pair of `CurrencySymbol` and `TokenName`.
You can think of an Account as a `Map Token Integer`, where

[source,haskell]
----
data Token = Token CurrencySymbol TokenName
----

Cardano's Ada token is `Token adaSymbol adaToken`. But you are free to create your own currencies
and tokens.

Tokens of a currency can represent roles in a contract, e.g "buyer" and "seller".
Think of a legal contract in the sense of
"hereafter referred to as the Performer/Vendor/Artist/Consultant".
This way we can decouple the notion of ownership of a contract role, and make it tradable.
So you can sell your loan or buy a share of a role in some contract.


[source]
----
tradeRoles = CurrencySymbol "TradeRoles"
buyer = TokenName "buyer"
seller = TokenName "seller"
account = fromList[(Token tradeRoles buyer, 1), (ada 1000)]
----

Here `account` holds a `buyer` token of currency "TradeRoles", and 1000 Ada.

A `Party` is represented as either a public key hash or a role name.

[source,haskell]
----
data Party  = PK PubKeyHash | Role TokenName
----

In order to progress a Marlowe contract, a party must provide an evidence.
For `PK` party that would be a valid signature of a transaction signed by
a private key of a public key that hashes to party's `PubKeyHash`, similarly to Bitcoin's
`Pay to Public Key Hash` mechanism.
For a `Role` party the evidence is spending a `role token` within the same transaction,
usually to the same owner.

So, `Role` parties will look like `(Role "alice")`, `(Role "bob")` and so on.
However, Haskell allows us to present and read in these values more concisely (by declaring a custom instance of `Show` and using _overloaded strings_) so that these can be input and read as `"alice"`, `"bob"` etc.

Slot numbers and amounts of money are treated in a similar way; with the same show/overload approach they will appear in contracts as numbers:

[source,haskell]
----
data Slot    = Slot Integer
type Timeout = Slot
----


Accounts have a number `NumAccount` and an owner, who is a `Party` to the contract.
[source,haskell]
----
type NumAccount = Integer
data AccountId  = AccountId NumAccount Party
----
and an example would be `AccountId 0 "alice"`. Note that `"alice"` is the owner here in the sense that she will be refunded any money in the account when the contract terminates.

Because in many contracts, each party will own at most one account, we can use overloaded strings to allow us to abbreviate this account – account number `0` for any owner – by the name of its owner: in this case `"alice"`.

A payment can be made to one of the parties to the contract, or to one of the accounts of the contract, and this is reflected in the definition

[source,haskell]
----
data Payee = Account AccountId
           | Party Party
----

Choices – of integers – are identified by `ChoiceId` which combines a name for the choice with the `Party` who had made the choice:
[source,haskell]
----
type ChoiceName = Text
data ChoiceId   = ChoiceId ChoiceName Party
type ChosenNum  = Integer
----
Values, as defined using `Let` are also identified by integers.footnote:[This may be modified in the future to allow values to be named by strings.]
[source,haskell]
----
data ValueId    = ValueId Integer
----

=== Values, observations and actions

Building on the basic types, we can describe three higher-level components of contracts: a type of _values_, on top of that a type of _observations_, and also a type of _actions_, which trigger particular cases. First, looking at `Value` we have

[source,haskell]
----
data Value = AvailableMoney AccountId Token
           | Constant Integer
           | NegValue Value
           | AddValue Value Value
           | SubValue Value Value
           | MulValue Value Value
           | Scale Rational Value
           | ChoiceValue ChoiceId
           | SlotIntervalStart
           | SlotIntervalEnd
           | UseValue ValueId
           | Cond Observation Value Value
----
The different kinds of values – all of which are `Integer` – are pretty much self explanatory, but for completeness we have

* Lookup of the value in an account `AvailableMoney`, made in a choice `ChoiceValue` and in an identifier that has already been defined `UseValue`.
* Arithmetic constants and operators.
* `Scale` multiplies a `Value` by a rational constant, say, 2/3, and rounds the result using 'half even' aka 'banking' rounding. So, 14/10 rounds to 1, both 15/10 and 25/10 rounds to 2.
* The start and end of the current _slot interval_; see below for further discussion of this.
* `Cond` represents if-expressions, that is - first argument to `Cond` is a condition (`Observation`) to check, second is a `Value` to take when condition is satisfied and the last one is a `Value` for unsatisfied condition; for example: `(Cond FalseObs (Constant 1) (Constant 2))` is equivalent to `(Constant 2)`
* `Assert` does not have any effect on the state of the contract, but it issues a warning when the `Observation` is false. It can be used to ensure that a property holds in any given point of the contract, since static analysis will fail if any execution causes an `Assert` to be false. 

Next we have observations

[source,haskell]
----
data Observation = AndObs Observation Observation
                 | OrObs Observation Observation
                 | NotObs Observation
                 | ChoseSomething ChoiceId
                 | ValueGE Value Value
                 | ValueGT Value Value
                 | ValueLT Value Value
                 | ValueLE Value Value
                 | ValueEQ Value Value
                 | TrueObs
                 | FalseObs
----

These are really self-explanatory: we can compare values for (in)equality and ordering, and combine observations using the Boolean connectives. The only other construct `ChoseSomething` indicates whether any choice has been made for a given `ChoiceId`.

Cases and actions are given by these types:

[source,haskell]
----
data Case = Case Action Contract

data Action = Deposit AccountId Party Token Value
            | Choice ChoiceId [Bound]
            | Notify Observation

data Bound = Bound Integer Integer
----
Three kinds of action are possible:

* A `Deposit n p t v` makes a deposit of value `v` of token `t` into account number `n` belonging to party `p`.
* A choice is made for a particular id with a list of bounds on the values that are acceptable.  For example, `[Bound 0 0, Bound 3 5]` offers the choice of one of `0`, `3`, `4` and `5`.
* The contract is notified that a particular observation be made. Typically this would be done by one of the parties, or one of their wallets acting automatically.

This completes our discussion of the types that make up Marlowe contracts.

=== Dynamic data

As we noted earlier, the semantics of Marlowe consist in building _transactions_, like this:
[#img-transaction]
[caption="Figure 1: "]
image:transaction.svg[]
A transaction is built from a series of steps, some of which consume an input value, and others produce effects, or payments. In describing this we explained that a transaction modified a contract (to its continuation) and the state, but more precisely we have a function
[source,haskell]
----
computeTransaction :: TransactionInput -> State -> Contract -> TransactionOutput
----
where the types are defined like this:
[source,haskell]
----
data TransactionInput = TransactionInput
    { txInterval :: SlotInterval
    , txInputs   :: [Input] }

data TransactionOutput =
    TransactionOutput
        { txOutWarnings :: [ReduceWarning]
        , txOutPayments :: [Payment]
        , txOutState    :: State
        , txOutContract :: Contract }
    | Error TransactionError
----
The notation used here adds field names to the arguments of the constructors, giving selectors for the data as well as making in clearer the purpose of each field.

The `TransactionInput` type has two components: the `SlotInterval` in which it can validly be added to the blockchain, and an ordered sequence of `Input` values to be processed in that transaction.

A `TransactionOutput` value has four components: the last two are the updated `State` and `Contract`, while the second gives a ordered sequence of `Payments` produced by the transaction. The first component contains a list of any warnings produced by processing the transaction.

=== Slot ranges

This is part of the architecture of Cardano/Plutus, which acknowledges that it is not possible to predict precisely in which slot a particular transaction will be processed. Transactions are therefore given a _slot interval_ in which they are expected to be processed, and this carries over to Marlowe: each step of a Marlowe contract is processed in the context of a range of slots.
[source,haskell]
----
data Slot         = Slot Integer
data SlotInterval = SlotInterval Slot Slot

ivFrom, ivTo :: SlotInterval -> Slot
ivFrom (SlotInterval from _) = from
ivTo   (SlotInterval _ to)   = to
----
How does this affect the processing of a Marlowe contract? Each step is processed relative to a slot interval, and the current slot value needs to lie within that interval.

The endpoints of the interval are accessible as the values `SlotIntervalStart` and `SlotIntervalEnd`, and these can be used in observations. Timeouts need to be processed _unambiguously_, so that _all values in the slot interval_ have to either have exceeded the timeout for it to take effect, or fall before the timeout, for normal execution to take effect. In other words, the timeout value needs to either be less or equal than `SlotIntervalStart` (in order for the timeout to take effect) or be strictly greater than `SlotIntervalEnd` (for normal execution to take place).

==== Notes

The model makes a number of assumptions about the blockchain
infrastructure in which it is run.

* It is assumed that cryptographic functions and operations are provided
by a layer external to Marlowe, and so they need not be modelled
explicitly.
* We assume that time is “coarse grained” and measured by block or
slot number, so that, in particular, timeouts are delimited using
block/slot numbers.
* Making a deposit is not something that a contract can perform;
rather, it can request that a deposit is made, but that then has to
be established externally: hence the input of (a collection of) deposits for
each transaction.
* The model manages the refund of funds back to the owner of a particular account when a
contract reaches the point of `Close`.
