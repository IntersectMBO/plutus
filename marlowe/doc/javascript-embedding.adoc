== Marlowe in JavaScript

In this tutorial show how we can _embed_  Marlowe in JavaScript to make more readable, modular
and reusable descriptions of Marlowe contracts. JavaScript is edited in the JS pane of the Marlowe Playground, as shown here.

The editor supports syntax highlighting, completion, and 'squiggly line' feedback. Mousing over defined elements will reveal their types, and over types their definitions.

The form of the code in the code editor should be

[source,typescript]
----
import * as bignumber from 'bignumber.js';
import { role, choiceId, party, token, ada, valueId, availableMoney, constant,
         negValue, addValue, subValue, mulValue, scale, choiceValue, slotIntervalStart,
         slotIntervalEnd, useValue, cond, andObs, orObs, notObs, choseSomething, valueGE,
         valueGT, valueLT, valueLE, valueEQ, trueObs, falseObs, bound, deposit, choice,
         notify, caseM, closeM, payM, ifM, whenM, letM, assertM, Party, SomeNumber,
         ChoiceId, Token, ValueId, Value, EValue, Observation, Bound, Action,
         Payee, Case, Contract } from 'marlowe-js';

/* === Code above this comment will be removed at compile time === */

const alice : Party = {"pk_hash":"alice"} ;
const bob : Party   = {"pk_hash":"bob" };

const payAB = payM(alice,party(bob),ada,10,closeM);

payAB
----

The imports above the comment line import the JS embedding of Marlowe, and using mouseover gives types and type definitions, as noted earlier.

The contract being defined is the last expression in the buffer, which should be of type `Contract`: here it is the constant `payAB`. In defining this expression, any of the other JS definitions can be used: here `alice` and `bob` are first defined, then used in defining `payAB` itself.

To construct contracts we provide _smart constructors_ – JavaScript functions – that construct contracts from their components. These mirror the definition of Marlowe: for instance `ifM` mirrors `If` in Marlowe.

[source,typescript]
----
export const ifM =
    function (obs : Observation, contThen : Contract, contElse : Contract) : Contract {
        /* === Code implementing the constructor === */
    };
----


In this example the contact is built from two contracts for the ‘then’ and ‘else’ cases, corresponding to the result of evaluating the `Observation`.

=== Compilation and Simulation

Contracts written in JavaScript are _compiled_ to Marlowe by selecting the *Compile* button. If compilation is successful, then the contract can be transferred to the simulation pane to be analysed and simulated by selecting the *Send to Simulator* button.
