== Marlowe in Blockly

So far in these tutorials we have concentrated on building contracts in the textual version of Marlowe, embedded in Haskell, Marlowe contracts can also be built using the Blockly visual programming environment, as we describe here.

=== Getting started

<<<<<<< HEAD
To start building a Blockly project in the Marlowe Playground, which you can find out more about in the section about xref:playground-overview#playground-overview[], select *New Project* and then *Blockly* for the project type. You'll now see a screen like this:

Contracts are assembled by adding components to the holes in the blocks. To build a contract, we have to fill the single, top-level, hole here with a `Contract`, and blocks for these are found by clicking on *Contracts* in the menu on the left hand side. Doing this shows all the different blocks that build contracts, as shown here:

<<<<<<< HEAD
We can select one and drag it into the editing area, which has a dotted background, like this:

We can select one and drag it into the pane, like this:

and then fit it into the top-level hole, so that we're constructing a contract with a `When` as its main construct.

<<<<<<< HEAD
 
We can then repeat this process, adding contracts and other types of components – all of which are shown in the menu on the left-hand side – to build a complete contract, that is a contract that contains no holes.

Let's fill in the timeout information and add a `Close` contract to be performed in the case of timeout:

This is the process that we repeat, adding contracts and other types of components – all shown in the menu on the left-hand side – to build a complete contract.

Let's fill in the timeout information and put a `Close` contract to perform on timeout:

What action should we choose now? Again we see all the possible actions by selecting *Actions* in the menu:

If we select a `Deposit` action we have a number of different types of holes to fill.

image:blockly7.png[Making a Deposit]

Here we have to choose 

* A *Role* for the depositor
* A *Value* which is the amount deposited …
* … in the *Token* (often *ada*)
<<<<<<< HEAD
* Where the money is to be deposited, give by a *Party*, which is either a *Role* or a *Public Key*.
=======
* Whose account, another *Role*, into which the money is deposited.
>>>>>>> 93f75fa42358dcfedb80499348f51a93d3d20e68

In filling in some of these we have also to fill in a text field, or a number, as shown in the final result here.

Finally, we have to decide what the _continutation_ contract is: what does the contract do next? That's another contract. Here it is completed as a payment:

____
*Exercises*

In Blockly, complete for yourself the construction of the contract above.

What is the effect of the example contract? In particular, what are the payments made by the contract?

=== Editing Blockly

Blockly contracts can be manipulated and edited using visual gestures and keyboard short cuts.

image:blockly10.png[Right-click menu]

* Blocks can be *dragged* from holes, as well as being inserted.
* There is a *right click menu* available, as seen in the image above, offering a range of options.
* Typical editing short cuts are operative, e.g. DEL, ⌘C, ⌘V, and ⌘X on Mac OS.
