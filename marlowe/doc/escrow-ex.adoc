[#escrow-ex]
== A first example

This tutorial introduces a simple financial contract in pseudocode,
before explaining how it is modified to work in Marlowe, giving the
first example of a Marlowe contract.

=== A simple escrow contract

image:escrow.png[Escrow]

Suppose that `+alice+` wants to buy a cat from `+bob+`, but neither of
them trusts the other. Fortunately, they have a mutual friend `+carol+`
whom they both trust to be neutral (but not enough to give her the money
and act as an intermediary). They therefore agree on the following
contract, written using simple functional pseudocode. This kind of
contract is a simple example of _escrow_.

[source,haskell]
----
When aliceChoice
     (When bobChoice
           (If (aliceChosen `ValueEQ` bobChosen)
               agreement
               arbitrate))
----

The contract is described using the _constructors_ of a Haskell data
type. The outermost constructor `+When+` has two arguments: the first is
an _observation_ and the second is another contract. The intended
meaning of this is that _when_ the action happens, the second
contract is activated.

The second contract is itself another `When` – asking for a decision from `+bob+` – but inside that, there is a _choice_: `If`
`+alice+` and `+bob+` agree on what to do, it is done; if not,  `+carol+` is asked to arbitrate and make a decision.

In general `When` offers a _list of cases_,footnote:[Lists in Marlowe are included in square brackets, as in `[2,3,4\]`.] each with an action and a corresponding contract that is triggered when that action happens. Using this we can allow for the option of `+bob+` making the first choice, rather than `+alice+`, like this:

[source,haskell]
----
  When [ Case aliceChoice
              (When [ Case bobChoice
                          (If (aliceChosen `ValueEQ` bobChosen)
                             agreement
                             arbitrate) ],
        Case bobChoice
              (When [ Case aliceChoice
                          (If (aliceChosen `ValueEQ` bobChosen)
                              agreement
                              arbitrate) ]
       ]
----
In this contract, either Alice or Bob can make the first choice; the other then makes a choice. If they agree, then that is done; if not, Carol arbitrates. In the remainder of the tutorial we'll revert to the simpler version where `alice` chooses first.

____
*Exercise*

Think about executing this contract in practice. Suppose that Alice has
already committed some money to the contract. What will happen if Bob chooses not to participate any further?

We have assumed that Alice has already committed her payment, but
suppose that we want to design a contract to ensure that: what would we
need to do to?

=== Escrow in Marlowe

Marlowe contracts incorporate extra constructs to ensure that they progress properly. Each time we see a `When`, we need to provide two additional things:

* a _timeout_ after which the contract will progress, and
* the _continuation_ contract to which it progresses.



=== Adding timeouts

First, let us examine how to modify what we have written to take care of
the case that the condition of the `+When+` never becomes true. So, we add timeout and continuation values to each `+When+` occurring in the contract.

[source,haskell]
----
  When [ Case aliceChoice
              (When [ Case bobChoice
                          (If (aliceChosen `ValueEQ` bobChosen)
                             agreement
                             arbitrate) ]
                    60            -- ADDED
                    arbitrate)    -- ADDED
        ]
        40           -- ADDED
        Close        -- ADDED
----

The outermost `When` calls for the first choice to be made by Alice: if Alice has not made a choice by slot `40`, the contract is closed and all the funds in the contract are refunded.

`Close` is typically the last step in every “path” through a Marlowe contract, and its effect is to refund the money in the contract to the participants; we will describe this in more detail when we look at xref:marlowe-step-by-step#marlowe-step-by-step[Marlowe step by step] in a later tutorial. In this particular case, refund will happen at slot number `40`.

Looking at the inner constructs, if Alice's choice has been made, then we wait for one from Bob. If that is not forthcoming by slot `60`, then Carol is called upon to arbitrate.footnote:[Again, we will describe how `arbitrate` and `agreement` work in xref:embedded-marlowe#embedded-marlowe[embedded Marlowe].]

=== Adding commitments

Next, we should look at how _cash is committed_ as the first step of the
contract.

[source,haskell]
----
 When [Case (Deposit "alice" "alice" ada price)   -- ADDED
  (When [ Case aliceChoice
              (When [ Case bobChoice
                          (If (aliceChosen `ValueEQ` bobChosen)
                             agreement
                             arbitrate) ]
                    60
                    arbitrate)
        ]
        40
        Close)
    ]
    10                                      -- ADDED
    Close                                   -- ADDED
----

A deposit of `price` is requested from `"alice"`: if it is given, then it is held in an account, also called `"alice"`. Accounts like this exist for the life of the contract only; each account belongs to a single contract.

There is a timeout at slot number `10` on making the deposit; if that is reached without a deposit being made, the contract is closed and all the money already in the contract is refunded. In this case, that is simply the end of the contract.


=== Definitions


We will see xref:embedded-marlowe#embedded-marlowe[later] that parts of this
contract description, such as `+arbitrate+`, `agreement`, and `price`, use the Haskell
_embedding_ of Marlowe DSL to give some shorthand definitions. We also use _overloaded_ strings to make some descriptions – e.g. of accounts – more concise.

These are discussed in more detail when we look at xref:embedded-marlowe#embedded-marlowe[embedded Marlowe].

____
*Exercise*

Comment on the choice of timeout values, and look at alternatives.

For
example, what would happen if the timeout of `+40+` on the `+When+` were
to be replaced by `+60+`, and vice versa? Would it be sensible to have the same timeout, of
`+100+` say, on each `When`? If not, why not?
____

This example has shown many of the ingredients of the Marlowe contract
language; in the next tutorial we will present the complete language.

=== Notes

* While accounts names need to be provided manually in the example here,
these could be generated by users’ wallets in a version of Marlowe
deployed on a blockchain.
