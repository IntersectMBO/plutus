== Wallets Simulation

The wallets simulation is a "bleeding-edge" feature that is still under development however it's already an interesting way to understand how a Marlowe contract will function in more detail and how a contract will appear from the perspective of each party involved.

If you click on the fifth tab in the playground, labelled "Wallets", you will be presented with an almost blank screen with just a few possible actions. This pane will soon show various wallets involved in a contract however first you need to create those wallets. Click on the `+` button to create a new wallet.

=== Wallet Contents

A wallet contains the following:

* Assets - these are tokens that the wallet owns, such as some Ada.
* Roles - these are contract roles that a wallet owns. If you own a role then you can take contract actions on behalf of those roles.
* Contracts - a wallet can be involved in mutliple running contracts.

To get started we need a valid contract, so go back to the "Simulation" tab and load the example "Escrow" contract. Now go back to the "Wallets" tab and click on "Load Contract from Simulation". This will load the contents of the Simulation editor as long as it is currently valid (in our case, the Escrow contract). You will see the contents of the contract as well as any roles that appear (in our case alice, bob and carol).

=== Roles

The roles are owned by the wallet that loaded the contract at the start but we can transfer them to other wallets. Click on the `+` button again to create a new wallet. This wallet will now be empty but lets go back to "Wallet 1" and transfer ownership of the role "alice" to "Wallet 2" by selecting it from the drop-down list.

Now go back to "Wallet 2" and you will see that the role "alice" has been transfered to "Wallet 2" as well as "Contract 1" being displayed. The contract is displayed because Wallet 2 is now involved in the contract (since it owns the role alice).

=== Running a contract

Stay in Wallet 2 and lets start the contract by clicking on the "Start" button. You will now see the current state of the contract displayed as well as possible actions. In our case it is possible to make a deposit on behalf of alice.

Let's go back to Wallet 1 and you will see that there are no possible actions, this is because the escrow contract can only progress if alice makes a deposit (or if the contract expires).

=== Taking Actions

Let's go back to Wallet 2 and add the deposit input to the transaction composer by clicking on the `+` button. You should see an error message `Insufficient funds to add this input`. The wallet needs to deposit 450 lovelace but it doesn't have any! Go to the top of the page and add 1000 lovelace using the input box and click the `+` button. You should now see under assets that Wallet 2 has 1000 lovelace. Now we can add the input to the transaction compser again.

You should see that the Deposit has moved to the transaction composer and a new input is available. It is possible to make a multiple inputs in a single transaction but for now we will just add one. Click the "Apply" button and you should see that both the state and the contract have changed. You will also notice under Assets that Wallet 2 now only has 550 lovelace.

At this point, alice is still the only role that can progress the contract so let's go ahead and create a new transaction with the input of alice choosing 0. Once we apply this transaction we will see that there are now no longer any further possible actions we can take. Go back to Wallet 1 and we can see that there is now a possible input that we can take. Lets construct a transaction of Bob choosing 0 and click "Apply".

The state changes again and the contract is now closed, no further actions can be taken. We can also see that the 450 have been transfered to Wallet 1. This is because Wallet 1 owns the role bob and the contract stated that if both alice and bob chose 0 then the 450 lovelace should be transfered to bob.

=== Other Features

It is possible to have multiple contracts running at the same time. You can go back to the Simulation tab and create a different contract then go to the Wallets tab and "Load Contract from Simulation" again.

You can move to the Next slot in the block chain by pressing the "Next Slot" link on the right-hand side.

The state of the blockchain can be reset by clicking on the "Reset Blockchain" link, also on the right-hand side. This will "go backwards in time" and undo all actions taken as well as resetting the slot number to 0.

Finally you can reset the whole simulation by clicking on the "Clear All" link at the top. This will delete all wallets and loaded contracts and reset the blockchain to slot 0.

=== Final Notes

As stated at the beginning of this section, the Wallets simulation is a new feature and we intend to develop it further in the future however hopefully it has given you a better understanding of how a contract will develop in the real world and how it will appear to real users.
