  # otherwise e.g. you could format the code in HLS and then have the CI
  # complain that it's wrong
  #
  # The solution we use here is to:
  # a) Where we care (mostly just formatters), constrain the versions of
  #    tools which HLS uses explicitly
  # b) Pull out the tools themselves from the HLS project so we can use
  #    them elsewhere
