# The flake.nix is the entrypoint of all nix code.
#
# This repository uses the std tool https://github.com/divnix/std.
# Familiarity with std is required to be able to contribute effectively.
# While official documentation for std can be found in its GitHub, this flake
# has been thoroughly commented so as to quickstart new maintainers.
#
# Most of what there is to know about the nix code inside this repository
# can be learned by reading this file. A second read will be needed as some
# std-specific terms may be referenced first and defined later.
# You may also refer to the glossary: https://divnix.github.io/std/glossary.html

        #   plutus

        # Each organelle must be either:
        #   A nix file named after the organelle
        #   A directory named after the organelle and containing a default.nix
        # Organelles have types.
        # Not all cells have the same organelles.
        # All organelles belong in a cell.
        #

        #   devshells :: devshells
        #     Development shells available via nix develop
        #   packages :: installables
        #     Packages available via nix build
        #   devshellProfiles :: functions
        #     Building blocks for devshells, not exposed to the flake
        #   scripts :: functions
        #     Bash scripts simplifying or automating a variety of tasks
        #     Generally these are available as commands inside the development shell
        #     These are very repository specific, and are not exposed to the flake
        #   library :: functions
        #     Functions and non-derivation values (e.g. attrs of derivations) shared
        #     across the current cell.
        #     These are very repository specific, and are not exposed to the flake
        #
        # std provides a TUI to interact with the organelles.
        # Available interactions are determined by the organelle's type.
        # Because this repository does not yet use the TUI, the type is mostly irrelevant.

  # # # # # THE STANDARD FORMAT OF NIX FILES
  #
  # Notice how *every single nix file* in this repository (with the exception
  # of flake.nix) has the same format:
  #
  # { inputs, cell }: ...
  #
  # There is no escaping this.
  # A description of the arguments follows:
  #
  #   inputs.self
  #     This is a path pointing to the top level of the repository.
  #     It is the *only* way to reference source files inside the repository.
  #     e.g.: { src = inputs.self + /plutus-core-spec; }
  #
  #   inputs.cells
  #     Provides access to all cells.
  #     Remember that a cell is named after its folder.
  #     The full format is inputs.cells.<cell>.<organelle>.value
  #     e.g.: inputs.cells.doc.packages.read-the-docs-site
  #     e.g.: inputs.cells.toolchain.devshellsProfiles.common
  #     e.g.: inputs.cells.haskell.devshells.haskell-shell
  #
  #   inputs.*flakeInput*
  #     The flake inputs proper.
  #     e.g.: inputs.std
  #     e.g.: inputs.nixpkgs
  #     e.g.: inputs.sphinxcontrib-haddock
  #
  #   cell.*organelle*
  #     The cell value gives access to all its organelles:
  #     e.g.: cell.scripts.serve-read-the-docs-site (only works for code in /nix/scripts)
  #       Alternatively: inputs.cells.doc.scripts.serve-read-the-docs-site (works everywhere)
  #     e.g.: cell.packages.repo-root.nix (only works for code in /nix/toolchain)
  #       Alternatively: inputs.cells.toolchain.packages.repo-root (works everywhere)


  # # # # # ONE DERIVATION PER NIX FILE
  #
  # To enforce further discipline, we enact a one-derivation-per-file policy.
  # This is currently applied *without exception*.
  #
  # This means that every single nix file in this repository is either:
  # - A default.nix organelle importing and thus grouping all files in its folder
  # - A file evaluating to a single derivation
  #
  # Further, we enforce that the nix fragment name be equal to the file name.
  # This means that if one looks at the fully expanded structure of the cellsFrom folder,
  # one will conclude that there are exactly as many fragments as there are nix files
  # (excluding the default.nix files, which again merely act as a grouper for the organelle).
  #
  # Finally this means that for each nix file "some-fragment.nix", one can run:
  # nix (develop|build|run) .#some-fragment
  # That is unless the relevant organelle was not exposed by the flake.
  #
  # Also note that while virtually all nix files evaluate to derivations, some
  # (like the ones in the library organelle) actually evaluate to functions.
  # So it is more accurate to say that the convention is to export one
  # (non-attribute-set!) nix value per nix file.


  # # # # # REFERENCE EXAMPLE
  #
  # As an example, consider the file /nix/doc/packages/eutxo-paper.nix:
  #
  # - /doc is the cell name
  # - /doc is accessible via cell.* from { inputs, cell } (while inside /nix/doc)
  # - /doc is accessible via inputs.cells.doc (everywhere)
  # - /packages is the organelle name
  # - /packages is accessible via cell.packages (while inside /nix/doc)
  # - /packages is accessible via inputs.cells.doc.packages (everywhere)
  # - /eutxo-paper.nix contains a *single derivation*
  # - eutxo-paper is the name of the flake fragment
  # - A derivation named eutxo-paper is accessible via cell.packages.eutxo-paper
  # - And also accessible via inputs.cells.doc.packages.eutxo-paper
  # - And also buildable via nix build .#eutxo-paper
  #
  # As another example, consider the file /nix/toolchain/packages/default.nix
  #
  # - /toolchain is the cell name
  # - /toolchain is accessible via cell.* from { inputs, cell } (while inside /nix/toolchain)
  # - /toolchain is accessible via inputs.cells.toolchain (everywhere)
  # - /packages is the organelle name
  # - /packages is accessible via cell.packages (while inside /nix/toolchain)
  # - /packages is accessible via inputs.cells.toolchain.packages (everywhere)
  # - /default.nix imports every file in its directory
  # - /default.nix contains a derivation for each file in its directory
  # - Each attrs field in /default.nix is named after the file it imports (minus the .nix)
