# The flake.nix is the entrypoint of all nix code.
#
# This repository uses the standard tool https://github.com/divnix/std.
# Familiarity with std is required to be able to contribute effectively.
# While official documentation for std can be found in its GitHub, this flake
# has been thoroughly commented so as to quickstart new maintainers.
# This flake can also be used as a template for new std-based projects.
# Further documentation can be found in __std__/README.md
#
# You may want to refer to the standard glossary as you go along:
# https://divnix.github.io/std/glossary.html

        # Each cell block must be either:
        #   A nix file named after the cell block

        #     Packages available via nix build

        #   scripts :: functions
        #     Bash scripts simplifying or automating a variety of tasks
        #     Generally these are available as commands inside the development shell
        #     These are very repository specific but are exposed to the flake nonetheless
