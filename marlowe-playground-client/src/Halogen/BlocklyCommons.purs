-- | Using the blockly events, detect when the contract has changed and fire a halogen message.
-- |
-- | There are two events that signal us that the contract has changed.
-- |   * When the Change event is fired (which means that a property inside a block has changed)
-- |   * When the Move event is fired and the old and new parent are different (which means that
-- |     a block has been attached/detached)
-- |
-- | We also need to track the UI events to see if we are in the middle of a drag-n-drop.
-- | When we attach a block into a new parent there is no problem, but when we detach a block there
-- | is a small inconsistency.
-- | When we start draging a block outside from its parent, Blockly will fire the Move event and let us
-- | believe that the contract has changed. But if we ask Blockly to generate the contract at that point,
-- | the result will include the block we just detached. So we need to accumulate the events fired during
-- | drag-n-drop and analyze them once we drop it.

-- | This function listens to blockly events and debounces the event listener so that the resulting
-- | Aff is completed after `time` milliseconds without events.
-- | NOTE: The part of this code that depends on blockly is rather minimal (addChangeListener workspace and
-- |       removeChangeListener workspace). We don't care about the contents of the event, just the fact that
-- |       it is fired, so we can debounce it.
-- |       If we need a debounce functionality later on, see if it makes sense to refactor this. I didn't do it
-- |       for the PR that introduced this code as it's not clear at the moment wether the debounce should be
-- |       tied to event listeners or if we can do it with plain Aff's
