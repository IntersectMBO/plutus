The Marlowe model allows for a contract to control money in a number of disjoint accounts: this allows for more explicit control of how the money flows in the contract. Each account is owned by a particular party to the contract, and that party receives a refund of any remaining funds in the account when the contract is closed. These accounts are local, in that they only exist as during the execution of the contract, and during that time they are only accessible by parties to the contract.

Contracts in Marlowe run on a blockchain, but need to interact with the off-chain world. The parties to the contract, whom we also call the participants, can engage in various actions: they can be asked to deposit money, or to make a choice between various alternatives. A notification of an external value (also called an oracle value), such as the current price of a particular commodity, is the other possible form of input.

A When contract contains a collection of cases. Each case has the form `Case action next` where action is an Action and next a continuation (another contract). When a particular action happens, the state is updated accordingly and the contract will continue as the corresponding continuation `next`.

Observations are Boolean values derived by comparing values, and can be combined using the standard Boolean operators. It is also possible to observe whether any choice has been made (for a particular identified choice).

Marlowe has five ways of building contracts. Four of these – Pay, Let, If and When – build a complex contract from simpler contracts, and the fifth, Close, is a simple contract. At each step of execution, as well as returning a new state and continuation contract, it is possible that effects – payments – and warnings can be generated too.

A Party is represented as either a public key hash or a role name.
In order to progress a Marlowe contract, a party must provide an evidence. For PK party that would be a valid signature of a transaction signed by a private key of a public key that hashes to party’s PubKeyHash, similarly to Bitcoin’s Pay to Public Key Hash mechanism. For a Role party the evidence is spending a role token within the same transaction, usually to the same owner.

So, Role parties will look like (Role "alice"), (Role "bob") and so on.
