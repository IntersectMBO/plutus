If needed these properties are also available for MoveEvent
  oldCoordinate	object	X and Y coordinates if it was a top level block. Undefined if it had a parent.
  newCoordinate	object	X and Y coordinates if it is a top level block. Undefined if it has a parent.
  workspaceId	string	UUID of workspace. The workspace can be found with Blockly.Workspace.getById(event.workspaceId)
  blockId	string	UUID of block. The block can be found with workspace.getBlockById(event.blockId)
  group	string	UUID of group. Some events are part of an indivisible group, such as inserting a statement in a stack.

-- This function let us check if a blockly event is of the desired type. It was inspired by unsafeReadProtoTagged
-- and the reason it's unsafe, it's because there could be other objects that have a property called `type` with
-- the appropiate value, but may not have the correct shape.
