-- This component is an UI element that allows you to have different panels with titles at the bottom of the page. Because the children of this component is set by the page, the Action type
-- is parameterized in two types:
--   * The `panel` type defines the possible panels we can have inside this widget. Each page that uses this widget defines a type (normally called BottomPanelView) with the possible panels.
--     This type needs to implement Eq for the render function to show the current selected pane. By allowing this to be a sum type, we can get the type safety in the render functions that
--     we need to implement all possible panels. If we don't care about that, we could refactor to a Map/Record and lose this parameter.
--   * The `action` type allows the posibility for a panel to fire actions on the parent page by using the PanelAction constructor. I think it could be eventually be refactored as a Variant/Run.
