{- Note [Normalized types in Scripts]
The Plutus Tx plugin and lifting machinery does not necessarily produce programs
with normalized types, but we are supposed to put programs on the chain *with*
normalized types.

So we normalize types when we turn things into 'Script's. The only operation we
do after that is applying 'Script's together, which preserves type normalization.
-}

{- Note [Eq and Ord for Scripts]
We need `Eq` and `Ord` instances for `Script`s mostly so we can put them in `Set`s.
However, the `Eq` instance for `Program`s is *alpha-equivalence*, and we don't
have a compatible `Ord` instance, nor is it easy to derive one.

So we piggyback off a different representation. In this instance we have two
options:
- Use the serialized form
- Use a hash
The problem with the latter is that we don't want to add a derived `Hashable` instance
for `Program`s that's not compatible with the `Eq` instance. We *could* add a derived
instance for `Program`s with de Bruijn indices, since in that case the derived `Eq`
coincides with alpha-equivalence. However, this might be faster.

For the moment we use the serialized form. We used to store the serialized form directly
in `Script`, but that led to a lot of deserializing and reserializing in `applyProgram`.
Here we have to serialize when we do `Eq` or `Ord` operations, but this happens comparatively
infrequently (I believe).

{- Note [Scripts returning Bool]
It used to be that the signal for validation failure was a script being `error`. This is nice for the validator, since
you can determine whether the script evaluation is error-or-not without having to look at what the result actually
*is* if there is one.

However, from the script author's point of view, it would be nicer to return a Bool, since otherwise you end up doing a
lot of `if realCondition then () else error ()` which is rubbish.

So we changed the result type to be Bool. But now we have to answer the question of how the validator knows what the
result value is. All *sorts* of terms can be True or False in disguise. The easiest way to tell is by reducing it
to the previous problem: apply a function which does a pattern match and returns error in the case of False and ()
otherwise. Then, as before, we just check for error in the overall evaluation.
-}

{- Note [Sealing data scripts]
To pass data scripts securely through the redeemer, we need to *seal* them. This means applying the 'seal' builtin
to the data script value, and then applying the redeemer to all the (sealed) values.

However, 'seal' is *polymorphic*, so we need to instantiate it at the correct type first. So we need to know the
type of all the data scripts, which means we need to typecheck them. This is annoying, but I don't have
another solution at the moment.
-}

{- Note [Impredicative polymorphism and seal]
We need to turn 'seal :: forall a . a -> Sealed a' into a PLC term, which we
can instantiate at a PLC type (which we do *not* have the corresponding Haskell type
for). But this causes GHC to get its knickers in a twist in two ways:
- GHC is very eager to replace the quantified type variable with 'Any', which we can't
currently reconstruct. See Note [Polymorphic values and Any] for more complaining.
- If you try and specify the type you end up asking for a 'CompiledCode (forall a . a -> Sealed a)'.
But this is impredicative polymorphism, and Banned.

So we apply the usual trick of wrapping it in a newtype wrapper. However, we then need
to *unwrap* it to actually apply the function, and the function which does *that* is
also going to be polymorphic, so we hit exactly the same problem defining it.

At this point we deploy a CURSED HACK. We compile newtypes into precisely their
underlying type... so we actually don't have to unwrap it at all! We just leave
it there to satisfy GHC and act as though it's unwrapped later. It's horrible, but
it seems to work.
