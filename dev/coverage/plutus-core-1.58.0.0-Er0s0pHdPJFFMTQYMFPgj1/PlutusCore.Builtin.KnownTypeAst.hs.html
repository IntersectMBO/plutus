<span class="lineno">   52 </span>{- Note [Rep vs Type context]
<span class="lineno">   53 </span>Say you define an @Id@ built-in function and specify its Haskell type signature:
<span class="lineno">   54 </span>
<span class="lineno">   55 </span>    id :: forall a. a -&gt; a
<span class="lineno">   56 </span>
<span class="lineno">   57 </span>This gets picked up by the 'TypeScheme' inference machinery, which detects @a@ and instantiates it
<span class="lineno">   58 </span>to @Opaque val Var0@ where @Var0@ is some concrete type (the exact details don't matter here)
<span class="lineno">   59 </span>representing a Plutus type variable of kind @*@ with the @0@ unique, so @id@ elaborates to
<span class="lineno">   60 </span>
<span class="lineno">   61 </span>    id :: Opaque val Var0 -&gt; Opaque val Var0
<span class="lineno">   62 </span>
<span class="lineno">   63 </span>But consider also the case where you want to define @id@ only over lists. The signature of the
<span class="lineno">   64 </span>built-in function then is
<span class="lineno">   65 </span>
<span class="lineno">   66 </span>    idList :: forall a. Opaque val [a] -&gt; Opaque val [a]
<span class="lineno">   67 </span>
<span class="lineno">   68 </span>Now the 'Opaque' is explicit and the 'TypeScheme' inference machinery needs to go under it in order
<span class="lineno">   69 </span>to instantiate @a@. Which now does not get instantiated to an 'Opaque' as before, since we're
<span class="lineno">   70 </span>already inside an 'Opaque' and can just use @Var0@ directly. So @idList@ elaborates to
<span class="lineno">   71 </span>
<span class="lineno">   72 </span>    idList :: Opaque val [Var0] -&gt; Opaque val [Var0]
<span class="lineno">   73 </span>
<span class="lineno">   74 </span>Now let's make up some syntax for annotating contexts so that it's clear what's going on:
<span class="lineno">   75 </span>
<span class="lineno">   76 </span>    idList @Type |
<span class="lineno">   77 </span>        :: (@Type | Opaque val (@Rep | [Var0]))
<span class="lineno">   78 </span>        -&gt; (@Type | Opaque val (@Rep | [Var0]))
<span class="lineno">   79 </span>
<span class="lineno">   80 </span>'@ann |' annotates everything to the right of it. The whole thing then reads as
<span class="lineno">   81 </span>
<span class="lineno">   82 </span>1. a builtin is always defined in the Type context
<span class="lineno">   83 </span>2. @-&gt;@ preserves the Type context, i.e. it accepts it and passes it down to the domain and codomain
<span class="lineno">   84 </span>3. @Opaque val@ switches the context from Type to Rep, i.e. it accepts the Type context, but
<span class="lineno">   85 </span>creates the Rep context for its argument that represents a Plutus type
<span class="lineno">   86 </span>
<span class="lineno">   87 </span>So why the distinction?
<span class="lineno">   88 </span>
<span class="lineno">   89 </span>The difference between the Rep and the Type contexts that we've seen so far is that in the Rep
<span class="lineno">   90 </span>context we don't need any @Opaque@, but this is a very superficial reason to keep the distinction
<span class="lineno">   91 </span>between contexts, since everything that is legal in the Type context is legal in the Rep context
<span class="lineno">   92 </span>as well. For example we could've elaborated @idList@ into a bit more verbose
<span class="lineno">   93 </span>
<span class="lineno">   94 </span>    idList :: Opaque val [Opaque val Var0] -&gt; Opaque val [Opaque val Var0]
<span class="lineno">   95 </span>
<span class="lineno">   96 </span>and the world wouldn't end because of that, everything would work correctly.
<span class="lineno">   97 </span>
<span class="lineno">   98 </span>The opposite however is not true: certain types that are legal in the Rep context are not legal in
<span class="lineno">   99 </span>the Type one and this is the reason why the distinction exists. The simplest example is
<span class="lineno">  100 </span>
<span class="lineno">  101 </span>    id :: Var0 -&gt; Var0
<span class="lineno">  102 </span>
<span class="lineno">  103 </span>@Var0@ represents a Plutus type variable and it's a data family with no inhabitants, so it does not
<span class="lineno">  104 </span>make sense to try to unlift a value of that type.
<span class="lineno">  105 </span>
<span class="lineno">  106 </span>Now let's say we added a @term@ argument to @Var0@ and said that when @Var0 term@ is a @GHC.Type@,
<span class="lineno">  107 </span>it has a @term@ inside, just like 'Opaque'. Then we would be able to unlift it, but we also have
<span class="lineno">  108 </span>things like @TyAppRep@, @TyForallRep@ and that set is open, any Plutus type can be represented
<span class="lineno">  109 </span>using such combinators and we can even name particular types, e.g. we could have @PlcListRep@,
<span class="lineno">  110 </span>so we'd have to special-case @GHC.Type@ for each of them and it would be a huge mess.
<span class="lineno">  111 </span>
<span class="lineno">  112 </span>So instead of mixing up types whose values are actually unliftable with types that are only used
<span class="lineno">  113 </span>for type checking, we keep the distinction explicit.
<span class="lineno">  114 </span>
<span class="lineno">  115 </span>The barrier between Haskell and Plutus is the barrier between the Type and the Rep contexts and
<span class="lineno">  116 </span>that barrier must always be some explicit type constructor that switches the context from Type to
<span class="lineno">  117 </span>Rep. We've only considered 'Opaque' as an example of such type constructor, but we also have
<span class="lineno">  118 </span>'SomeConstant' as another example.
<span class="lineno">  119 </span>
<span class="lineno">  120 </span>Some type constructors turn any context into the Type one, for example 'BuiltinResult' and
<span class="lineno">  121 </span>'Emitter', although they are useless inside the Rep context, given that it's only for type checking
<span class="lineno">  122 </span>Plutus and they don't exist in the type language of Plutus.
<span class="lineno">  123 </span>
<span class="lineno">  124 </span>These @*Rep@ data families like 'TyVarRep', 'TyForallRep' etc all require the Rep context and
<span class="lineno">  125 </span>preserve it, since they're only for representing Plutus types for type checking purposes. There's
<span class="lineno">  126 </span>however an exception: builtin applications get elaborated to iterated 'TyAppRep' calls (see e.g.
<span class="lineno">  127 </span>'ElaborateBuiltinDefaultUni') and those do appear in the Type context. This is purely for historical
<span class="lineno">  128 </span>reasons and what we should have instead is 'TyAppRep' that preserves the current context, whether
<span class="lineno">  129 </span>it's Rep or Type. The only reason why we can't have that right now is the Type context not including
<span class="lineno">  130 </span>higher-kinded types, which is also purely for historical reasons.
<span class="lineno">  131 </span>
<span class="lineno">  132 </span>Some type constructors preserve the current context, i.e. turn the Rep one back into Rep and the
<span class="lineno">  133 </span>Type one back into Type. @(-&gt;)@ is a prime example of such a type constructor.
<span class="lineno">  134 </span>
<span class="lineno">  135 </span>The context-switching logic is mostly internal to the 'ToHoles' type family, however none of the
<span class="lineno">  136 </span>requirements are checked there, e.g. from the 'ToHoles' point of view it's totally fine to have
<span class="lineno">  137 </span>'TyVarRep' within the Type context. Instead, some of those requirements are checked in the
<span class="lineno">  138 </span>elaboration machinery, just to give the user some helpful type error. We do it later in the
<span class="lineno">  139 </span>pipeline, because this way if the elaborator fails we can at least check what it failed on (see
<span class="lineno">  140 </span>'elaborateDebug'), while if we entangled it all together, it would be very hard to debug the
<span class="lineno">  141 </span>elaborator (and it's very complex).
<span class="lineno">  142 </span>
<span class="lineno">  143 </span>We call a thing in a Rep or Type context a 'RepHole' or 'TypeHole' respectively. The reason for the
<span class="lineno">  144 </span>name is that the elaboration machinery looks at the thing and tries to instantiate it, like fill a
<span class="lineno">  145 </span>hole.
<span class="lineno">  146 </span>
<span class="lineno">  147 </span>We could also have a third type of hole/context, Name, because binders bind names rather than
<span class="lineno">  148 </span>variables and so it makes sense to infer names sometimes, like for 'TyForallRep' for example.
<span class="lineno">  149 </span>We don't do that currently, because we don't have such builtins anyway.
<span class="lineno">  150 </span>
<span class="lineno">  151 </span>And there could be even fancier kinds of holes like &quot;infer anything&quot; for cases where the hole
<span class="lineno">  152 </span>is determined by some other part of the signature. We don't have that either, for the same reason.
<span class="lineno">  153 </span>
<span class="lineno">  154 </span>For the user defining a builtin this all is pretty much invisible.

<span class="lineno">  181 </span>The 'KnownTypeAst' class takes a @tyname@ argument. The reason for this is that we want to be able
<span class="lineno">  182 </span>to define 'mkTyBuiltin' such that it's generic over the type of names, because in addition to
<span class="lineno">  183 </span>'TyName' we also have 'TyDeBruijn' and it's convenient to seemlessly embed built-in types into a
<span class="lineno">  184 </span>'Type' regardless of which kind of names it expects.
<span class="lineno">  185 </span>
<span class="lineno">  186 </span>However we don't want that @tyname@ to proliferate through the entire code base. For example,
<span class="lineno">  187 </span>'HasTypeLevel' propagates up to PlutusTx and it doesn't make sense to mention implementation details

<span class="lineno">  189 </span>and can have full generality, we instantiate @tyname@ with 'Void', because anything can be recovered
