<span class="lineno">   39 </span>We need to support polymorphism for built-in functions for these reasons:
<span class="lineno">   40 </span>
<span class="lineno">   41 </span>1. @ifThenElse@ for 'Bool' (being a built-in type rather than a Scott-encoded one) has to be
<span class="lineno">   42 </span>polymorphic as its type signature is
<span class="lineno">   43 </span>
<span class="lineno">   44 </span>    ifThenElse : all a. Bool -&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a
<span class="lineno">   45 </span>
<span class="lineno">   46 </span>Previously we had 'Bool' as a Scott-encoded type, but this required plenty of supporting machinery,
<span class="lineno">   47 </span>because unlifting (aka Scott-decoding) a PLC 'Bool' to a Haskell 'Bool' is quite a non-trivial
<span class="lineno">   48 </span>thing. We got rid of it and now we have to pay for that by supporting polymorphic built-in functions
<span class="lineno">   49 </span>(but we added that support long ago anyway, 'cause it was easy to do).
<span class="lineno">   50 </span>
<span class="lineno">   51 </span>2. we have polymorphic built-in types such as lists and pairs and we need polymorphic built-in
<span class="lineno">   52 </span>functions to handle them
<span class="lineno">   53 </span>-}
<span class="lineno">   54 </span>
<span class="lineno">   55 </span>{- Note [Implementation of polymorphic built-in functions]
<span class="lineno">   56 </span>Encoding polymorphism in an AST in an intrinsically-typed manner is not a pleasant thing to do in
<span class="lineno">   57 </span>Haskell. It's not impossible, see &quot;Embedding F&quot;, Sam Lindley:
<span class="lineno">   58 </span>
<span class="lineno">   59 </span>    http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/slindley/papers/embedding-f.pdf
<span class="lineno">   60 </span>
<span class="lineno">   61 </span>but it's extremely heavy and we don't need it, hence we avoid it.
<span class="lineno">   62 </span>
<span class="lineno">   63 </span>Instead, we pass type tags at runtime and ensure that a built-in function can be applied to an
<span class="lineno">   64 </span>argument by checking equality of the type tag that we get by looking at the signature of the
<span class="lineno">   65 </span>denotation of the builtin and the type tag that we get at runtime as a part of the argument.
<span class="lineno">   66 </span>
<span class="lineno">   67 </span>But we don't need to check equality of type tags when the denotation of the builtin is polymorphic
<span class="lineno">   68 </span>over the type of its argument, because then we can simply pass the AST directly through the builtin
<span class="lineno">   69 </span>without ever extracting anything from it.
<span class="lineno">   70 </span>
<span class="lineno">   71 </span>We do still need to type check such a builtin in Plutus though, hence we introduce a @newtype@
<span class="lineno">   72 </span>wrapper for attaching a Plutus type to the argument, so that the Plutus type checker can pick it up.
<span class="lineno">   73 </span>
<span class="lineno">   74 </span>In particular, an opaque value whose type is a PLC type variable `a_0` has the following type on
<span class="lineno">   75 </span>the Haskell side:
<span class="lineno">   76 </span>
<span class="lineno">   77 </span>    Opaque val (TyVarRep ('TyNameRep &quot;a&quot; 0))
<span class="lineno">   78 </span>
<span class="lineno">   79 </span>where that last argument is a direct counterpart of the term-level
<span class="lineno">   80 </span>
<span class="lineno">   81 </span>    TyVar () (TyName (Name &quot;a&quot; 0))
<span class="lineno">   82 </span>
<span class="lineno">   83 </span>@Opaque val rep@ can be used for passing any @val@ through the builtin application machinery,
<span class="lineno">   84 </span>not just one whose type is a bound variable. For example, you can define a new data type
<span class="lineno">   85 </span>
<span class="lineno">   86 </span>    data NatRep
<span class="lineno">   87 </span>
<span class="lineno">   88 </span>provide a 'KnownTypeAst' instance for it and define a (rather pointless) builtin like
<span class="lineno">   89 </span>@idNat : nat -&gt; nat@.
<span class="lineno">   90 </span>
<span class="lineno">   91 </span>It's also possible to bind a type variable of a higher-kind, say, @f :: * -&gt; *@ and make a builtin
<span class="lineno">   92 </span>with the following signature:
<span class="lineno">   93 </span>
<span class="lineno">   94 </span>    idFInteger : all (f :: * -&gt; *). f integer -&gt; f integer
<span class="lineno">   95 </span>
<span class="lineno">   96 </span>where the type application is handled with 'TyAppRep'. Note that the latter is defined as a
<span class="lineno">   97 </span>@data family@:
<span class="lineno">   98 </span>
<span class="lineno">   99 </span>    data family TyAppRep (fun :: dom -&gt; cod) (arg :: dom) :: cod
<span class="lineno">  100 </span>
<span class="lineno">  101 </span>We do that because a @data family@ can return a poly-kinded argument, which allows us to get an
<span class="lineno">  102 </span>intrinsically-kinded representation of PLC types. For example, an opaque @term@ whose type is an
<span class="lineno">  103 </span>application of a type variable @f@ to a type variable @a@ is represented like this:
<span class="lineno">  104 </span>
<span class="lineno">  105 </span>    Opaque val (TyAppRep (TyVarRep ('TyNameRep &quot;f&quot; 0)) (TyVarRep ('TyNameRep &quot;a&quot; 1 :: TyNameRep *)))
<span class="lineno">  106 </span>
<span class="lineno">  107 </span>Note the @TyNameRep *@ kind annotation. It tells us three things:
<span class="lineno">  108 </span>
<span class="lineno">  109 </span>1. a type-level name has a kind associated with it. The reason for that is that we use names in
<span class="lineno">  110 </span>binders (for example, in the universal quantifier) and as variables and kinds are important in
<span class="lineno">  111 </span>both these cases due to us having an intrinsically-kinded representation of types, so it's
<span class="lineno">  112 </span>convenient to annotate type-level names with kinds. Another reason is that we do not attempt to do
<span class="lineno">  113 </span>any kind of static analysis on reflected type variables and associating kinds with them allows us
<span class="lineno">  114 </span>to catch errors like &quot;two variables with equal names and uniques, but different kinds&quot; earlier
<span class="lineno">  115 </span>2. the kind is not stored as an argument to the @TyNameRep@ constructor. Instead it's stored as
<span class="lineno">  116 </span>an index of the data type. The point of this is that if we stored the kind as an argument, we'd
<span class="lineno">  117 </span>have to provide it manually, but since the representation is intrinsically-kinded there's no point
<span class="lineno">  118 </span>in doing so as GHC can infer all the kinds itself
<span class="lineno">  119 </span>3. ... apart from cases where they're inherently ambiguous, like in the case above. If we don't
<span class="lineno">  120 </span>specify the kind of the @a_1@ type variable, then there's no way GHC could infer it as the variable
<span class="lineno">  121 </span>is passed as an argument to another variable with an unspecified kind (@f_0@)
<span class="lineno">  122 </span>4. finally, an opaque value can only be of a type of kind @*@. You can't construct a value whose
<span class="lineno">  123 </span>type is of some other kind. That's why we don't need to annotate the @f_0@ type variable: the domain
<span class="lineno">  124 </span>is inferred from the kind of the argument (where it's explicitly specified via @TyNameRep *@) and
<span class="lineno">  125 </span>the codomain is inferred from the fact that the whole type is passed to 'Opaque' and so it has to be
<span class="lineno">  126 </span>of kind @*@
<span class="lineno">  127 </span>
<span class="lineno">  128 </span>It would be nice if we didn't need to define that @*Rep@ stuff at the type level just to demote it
<span class="lineno">  129 </span>to the term level via a type class, but this hasn't been investigated yet. A plausible way would be
<span class="lineno">  130 </span>to ditch 'KnownTypeAst' (but keep 'ReadKnownIn' and 'MakeKnownIn') and provide PLC types
<span class="lineno">  131 </span>manually. But that doesn't seem to give rise to a terribly nice API. And we'd lose all the static
<span class="lineno">  132 </span>guarantees, which is not a big deal, but losing the automatic inference of type schemes would suck,
<span class="lineno">  133 </span>given that it's quite handy.
<span class="lineno">  134 </span>
<span class="lineno">  135 </span>Representing constructors as poly-kinded data families and handling those with open type families
<span class="lineno">  136 </span>and/or type classes is a way of solving the expression problem for indexed data types at the type
