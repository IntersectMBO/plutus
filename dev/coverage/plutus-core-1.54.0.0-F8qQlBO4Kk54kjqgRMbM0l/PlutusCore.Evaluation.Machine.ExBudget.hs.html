<span class="lineno">   18 </span>{- Note [Budgeting]
<span class="lineno">   19 </span>
<span class="lineno">   20 </span>When running Plutus code on the chain, you're running code on other peoples
<span class="lineno">   21 </span>machines, so you'll have to pay for it. And it has to be possible to determine
<span class="lineno">   22 </span>how much money that should be before sending the transaction with the Plutus
<span class="lineno">   23 </span>code to the chain. If you spend too little, your transaction will be rejected.
<span class="lineno">   24 </span>If you spend too much, you're wasting money. So it must be possible to estimate
<span class="lineno">   25 </span>how much a script will cost. The easiest way to do so is to run the script
<span class="lineno">   26 </span>locally and determine the cost. The functional nature of Plutus allows for the
<span class="lineno">   27 </span>assumption it will cost a similar amount locally as on the chain. See
<span class="lineno">   28 </span>'CekBudgetMode'.
<span class="lineno">   29 </span>
<span class="lineno">   30 </span>Additionally, it's helpful to know which parts of the script cost how much. We
<span class="lineno">   31 </span>assume it's useful to have a list of costs per term executed, so it's possible
<span class="lineno">   32 </span>to estimate which parts of the script cost how much. The 'ExTally' has not been
<span class="lineno">   33 </span>determined to be useful, but it was easy to implement.
<span class="lineno">   34 </span>
<span class="lineno">   35 </span>We're tracking execution cost via both memory (via 'ExMemory') and CPU (via
<span class="lineno">   36 </span>'ExCPU'). Node operators are more interested in space limits than time limits -
<span class="lineno">   37 </span>the memory upper limit will be reached faster than the time limit (which would
<span class="lineno">   38 </span>be until next block). The two resources are then converted to the main currency
<span class="lineno">   39 </span>of the chain based on protocol parameters - that way it's possible to adjust the
<span class="lineno">   40 </span>actual fees without changing the code.
<span class="lineno">   41 </span>
<span class="lineno">   42 </span>When tracking memory, we ignore garbage collection - only total memory
<span class="lineno">   43 </span>allocation is counted. This decision decouples us from the implementation of the
<span class="lineno">   44 </span>GC itself. Additionally, sharing of references is assumed. If a builtin
<span class="lineno">   45 </span>generates a new value, every reference of that value (e.g. in different CEK
<span class="lineno">   46 </span>environments) is assumed to point to the same value, without any copies. So the
<span class="lineno">   47 </span>total memory of the program is bounded to the original program + anything the
<span class="lineno">   48 </span>builtins produce + the machine space used by the CEK machine itself. The CEK
<span class="lineno">   49 </span>environment costs are included in the stack frame costs of the CEK machine,
<span class="lineno">   50 </span>they're linear.
<span class="lineno">   51 </span>
<span class="lineno">   52 </span>The tracking of the costs themselves does not cost any CPU or memory. Currently
<span class="lineno">   53 </span>that's an implementation detail. We may have to readjust this depending on real
<span class="lineno">   54 </span>world experience.
<span class="lineno">   55 </span>
<span class="lineno">   56 </span>The CEK machine does budgeting in these steps:
<span class="lineno">   57 </span>- The memory cost of the initial AST is added to the budget. See Note [Memory
<span class="lineno">   58 </span>  Usage for Plutus]. This operation currently does not cost any CPU. It
<span class="lineno">   59 </span>  currently costs as much memory as the AST itself, before aborting. See
<span class="lineno">   60 </span>  https://github.com/IntersectMBO/plutus/issues/1799 for more discussion.
<span class="lineno">   61 </span>- Then each machine reduction step requires a certain amount of memory and CPU.
<span class="lineno">   62 </span>- The builtin operations may require different amounts of memory and CPU,
<span class="lineno">   63 </span>  depending on the input size.
<span class="lineno">   64 </span>- If a computation runs out of Memory or CPU, it is aborted, via the same
<span class="lineno">   65 </span>  mechanism when 'error' is called.
<span class="lineno">   66 </span>
<span class="lineno">   67 </span>Tracking CEK machine layers is rather straightforward, albeit these numbers
<span class="lineno">   68 </span>still have to be filled in. For builtins (e.g. +, etc.) the cost tracking can be
<span class="lineno">   69 </span>a bit more complicated, as the required resources may depend on the size of the
<span class="lineno">   70 </span>inputs (E.g. multiplying numbers, where the output will be around 6 words if
<span class="lineno">   71 </span>both inputs are at 3 words each). These cost estimations will also have factors
<span class="lineno">   72 </span>attached which can be configured at runtime via protocol parameters - so it's
<span class="lineno">   73 </span>possible to adjust them at runtime.
<span class="lineno">   74 </span>

<span class="lineno">   77 </span>{- Note [Budgeting units]
<span class="lineno">   78 </span>
<span class="lineno">   79 </span> We use picoseconds for measuring times and words for measuring memory usage.
<span class="lineno">   80 </span> Some care is required with time units because different units are used in
<span class="lineno">   81 </span> different places.
<span class="lineno">   82 </span>
<span class="lineno">   83 </span> * The basic data for models of execution time is produced by Criterion
<span class="lineno">   84 </span>   benchmarks (run via plutus-core:cost-model-budgeting-bench) and saved in
<span class="lineno">   85 </span>   a CSV file (usually 'benching.csv').  At this point the time units are seconds.
<span class="lineno">   86 </span>
<span class="lineno">   87 </span> * The data in the CSV file is used by plutus-core:generate-cost-model to create
<span class="lineno">   88 </span>   cost-prediction models for the built-in functions, and data describing these
<span class="lineno">   89 </span>   is written to a JSON file (usually 'builtinCostModel.json'.  This process
<span class="lineno">   90 </span>   involves several steps:
<span class="lineno">   91 </span>
<span class="lineno">   92 </span>     * The CreateBuiltinCostModel module reads in the data from the CSV file
<span class="lineno">   93 </span>       and runs R code in 'models.R' to fit linear models to the benchmark
<span class="lineno">   94 </span>       results for each builtin.  This process (and its results) necessarily
<span class="lineno">   95 </span>       involves the use of floating-point numbers.
<span class="lineno">   96 </span>
<span class="lineno">   97 </span>       Builtin execution times are typically of the order of 10^(-6) or 10^(-7)
<span class="lineno">   98 </span>       seconds, and the benching data is converted to microseconds in 'models.R'
<span class="lineno">   99 </span>       because it's sometimes useful to work with the data interactively and this
<span class="lineno">  100 </span>       makes the numbers a lot more human-readable.
<span class="lineno">  101 </span>
<span class="lineno">  102 </span>     * The coefficients from the R models are returned to the Haskell code in
<span class="lineno">  103 </span>       CreateBuiltinCostModel and written out to a JSON file.  To avoid the
<span class="lineno">  104 </span>       use of floats in JSON and in cost prediction at runtime (which might be
<span class="lineno">  105 </span>       machine-dependent if floats were used), numbers are multiplied by 10^6
<span class="lineno">  106 </span>       and rounded to the nearest integer, shifting from the microsecond scale to
<span class="lineno">  107 </span>       the picosecond scale.  This rescaling is safe because all of our models
<span class="lineno">  108 </span>       are (currently) linear in their inputs.
<span class="lineno">  109 </span>
<span class="lineno">  110 </span> * When the Plutus Core evaluator is compiled, the JSON data in
<span class="lineno">  111 </span>   'builtinCostModel.json' is read in and used to create the defaultCostModel
<span class="lineno">  112 </span>   object.  This also includes information about the costs of basic CEK machine
<span class="lineno">  113 </span>   operations obtained from 'cekMachineCosts.json' (currently generated manually).
<span class="lineno">  114 </span>
<span class="lineno">  115 </span> * When the Plutus Core evaluator is run, the code in
<span class="lineno">  116 </span>   PlutusCore.Evaluation.Machine.BuiltinCostModel uses the data in
<span class="lineno">  117 </span>   defaultCostModel to create Haskell versions of the cost models which estimate
<span class="lineno">  118 </span>   the execution time of a built-in function given the sizes of its inputs.
<span class="lineno">  119 </span>   This (and the memory usage) are fed into a budgeting process which measures
<span class="lineno">  120 </span>   the ongoing resource consumption during script execution.
<span class="lineno">  121 </span>
<span class="lineno">  122 </span>   All budget calculations are (at least on 64-bit machines) done using the
<span class="lineno">  123 </span>   'SatInt' type which deals with overflow by truncating excessively large values
<span class="lineno">  124 </span>   to the maximum 'SatInt' value, 2^63-1.  In picoseconds this is about 106
<span class="lineno">  125 </span>   days, which should suffice for any code we expect to run.  Memory budgeting
<span class="lineno">  126 </span>   is entirely in terms of machine words, and floating-point issues are
<span class="lineno">  127 </span>   irrelevant.
<span class="lineno">  128 </span>
<span class="lineno">  129 </span> Some precision is lost during the conversion from R's floating-point models to
<span class="lineno">  130 </span> the integral numbers used in the Haskell models.  However, experimentation
<span class="lineno">  131 </span> shows that the difference is very small.  The tests in plutus-core:
<span class="lineno">  132 </span> cost-model-test run the R models and the Haskell models with a large number of
<span class="lineno">  133 </span> random inputs and check that they agree to within one part in 10,000, which
