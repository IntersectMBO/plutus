-- | A swap is an agreement to exchange cashflows at future dates. To keep
--  things simple, this is an interest rate swap (meaning that the cashflows are
--  interest payments on the same principal amount but with two different
--  interest rates, of which one is fixed and one is floating (varying with
--  time)) with only a single payment date.
--
--  At the beginning of the contract, the fixed rate is set to the expected
--  future value of the floating rate (so if the floating rate behaves as
--  expected, the two payments will be exactly equal).

{- Note [Swap Transactions]

The swap involves three transactions at two different times.

1. At t=0. Each participant deposits the margin. The outputs are locked with
   the same validator script, `swapValidator`
2. At t=n. The value of the floating rate, and consequently the values of the
   two payments are determined. Each participant gets their margin plus or
   minus the actual payment.

There is a risk of losing out if the interest rate moves outside the range of
fixedRate +/- (margin / notional amount). In a real financial contract this
would be dealt with by agreeing a "Variation Margin". This means that the
margin is adjusted at predefined dates before the actual payment is due. If one
of the parties fails to make the variation margin payment, the contract ends
prematurely and the other party gets to keep both margins.

Plutus should be able to handle variation margins in a series of validation
scripts. But it seems to me that they could get quite messy so I don't want to
write them by hand :) We can probably use TH to generate them at compile time.
