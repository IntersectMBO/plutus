{- note [Futures in Plutus]

A futures contract ("future") is an agreement to change ownership of an
asset at a certain time (the delivery time) for an agreed price (the forward
price). The time of the transfer, and the price, are fixed at the beginning of
the contract.

A future can be settled either by actually exchanging the asset for the price
(physical settlement) or by exchanging the difference between the forward price
and the spot (current) price.

In Plutus we could do physical settlement for assets that exist on the
blockchain, that is, for tokens and currencies (everything that's a 'Value'). But
the contract implemented here is for cash settlement.

The agreement involves two parties, a buyer (long position) and a seller (short
position). At the delivery time the actual price of the asset (spot price) is
quite likely different from the forward price. If the spot price is higher than
the forward price, then the seller transfers the difference to the buyer. If
the spot price is lower than the forward price, then the buyer transfers money
to the seller. In either case there is a risk that the payer does not meet their
obligation (by simply not paying). To protect against this risk, the contract
includes a kind of deposit called "margin".

Each party deposits an initial margin. If the price moves against the seller,
then the seller has to top up their margin periodically (in our case, once each
block). Likewise, if it moves against the buyer then the buyer has to top up
their margin. If either party fails to make a margin payment then the contract
will be settled early.

The current value of the underlying asset is determined by an oracle. See note
[Oracles] in Plutus.Contracts. Also note that we
wouldn't need oracles if this was a contract with physical settlement,

The contract has three phases: Initialisation, runtime, and settlement. In the
first phase both parties deposit their initial margins into an escrow contract.
The second phase is when the contract is "live". In this phase the contract
is a state machine whose state is the 'MarginnAccounts' with the current margins.
The transition from the second to the third phase happens either after the
settlement date, or if the sport price has moved so far that one of the margin
accounts is underfunded. The runtime and settlement phases are modeled as a state
machine, with 'FutureState' and 'FutureAction' types.
