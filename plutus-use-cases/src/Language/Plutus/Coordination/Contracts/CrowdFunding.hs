-- | The validator script that determines whether the campaign owner can
--   retrieve the funds or the contributors can claim a refund.
--
--   Assume there is a campaign `c :: Campaign` with two contributors
--   (identified by public key pc_1 and pc_2) and one campaign owner (pco).
--   Each contributor creates a transaction, t_1 and t_2, whose outputs are
--   locked by the scripts `contributionScript c pc_1` and `contributionScript
--   c pc_1` respectively.
--   There are two outcomes for the campaign.
--   1. Campaign owner collects the funds from both contributors. In this case
--      the owner creates a single transaction with two inputs, referring to
--      t_1 and t_2. Each input contains the script `contributionScript c`
--      specialised to a contributor. This case is covered by the
--      definition for `payToOwner` below.
--   2. Refund. In this case each contributor creates a transaction with a
--      single input claiming back their part of the funds. This case is
--      covered by the `refundable` branch.
