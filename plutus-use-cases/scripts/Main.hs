{-| Run an emulator trace and write the applied scripts to a file in Flat format
    using the name as a prefix.  There's an instance of Codec.Serialise for
    Script in Scripts.hs (see Note [Using Flat inside CBOR instance of Script]),
    which wraps Flat-encoded bytestings in CBOR, but that's not used here: we
    just use unwrapped Flat because that's more convenient for use with the
    `plc` command, for example.
