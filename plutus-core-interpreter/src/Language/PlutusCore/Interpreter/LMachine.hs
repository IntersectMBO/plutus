-- | The L machine
-- A lazy machine based on the L machine of Friedman et al. [Improving the Lazy Krivine Machine]
-- For more details see the document in plutus/docs/fomega/lazy-machine
-- The code here's closely based on the CEK machine implementation.

-- ## Things to fix soon.
--  # Generalise the machine return type so that we can return extra information,
--    like the environment and/or heap.  These are just discarded at the moment.
--  # Deal properly with dynamic builtins.
--  # Monadify some things (heap, dbnms)
--  # Remove the bit where it tries to force arguments to builtins;
--    Roman's new infrastructure should be able to handle this.
--  # Use something more efficient for the heap, like a mutable vector.

-- The main difference from the CEK machine is that we have a heap
-- containing closures containing evaluated/unevaluated function
-- arguments, and environments mapping variable IDs to heap locations.
-- To evaluate [M N], we save a closure C containing N and the current
-- environment in a stack frame, then evaluate M to get a value
-- (lambda/builtin) like \x.e and an environment env.  We retrieve the
-- argument closure C from the stack, generate a new heap location l,
-- bind C (unevaluated) to l in the heap, then evaluate e in
-- env[x->l].  When we come across a use of x inside e, we look up l
-- in the heap to get N (inside the closure C): if it's Evaluated then
-- we continue immediately, using N instead of x. Otherwise we place
-- an update marker on the stack and evaluate N to get a new closure
-- C' containing a value V (and a possibly new environment): by
-- this time we should be back at the update marker containing l, and
-- we store Evaluated C back in the heap at l, then continue
-- evaluating e.
