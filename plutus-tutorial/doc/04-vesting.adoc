[#multi-stage]
= Multi-stage contracts

In this part of the tutorial we will implement a simple vesting scheme,
where money is locked by a contract and may only be retrieved after some
time has passed.

This is our first example of a contract that covers multiple transactions,
with a contract state that changes over time.
