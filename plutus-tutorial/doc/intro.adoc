= Introduction to Plutus

Plutus is the smart contract platform of the Cardano blockchain. Plutus
contracts consist of pieces that go on the blockchain (on-chain code)
and pieces that run on the user’s machine (off-chain or client code).

Both on-chain and off-chain code is written in Haskell, and Plutus smart
contracts are Haskell programs. Off-chain code is compiled by GHC, the
Haskell compiler, and on-chain code is compiled by the Plutus compiler.

== Smart contracts

From the smart contract author’s perspective, the blockchain is a
distributed bookkeeping system. It keeps track of who owns how much of a
virtual resource (Bitcoin, Ada, etc.) and records when assets are
transferred from one entity to another. The owners of digital assets are
identified by their public keys, and they may be people or machines.

Smart contracts are programs that control the transfer of resources on
the blockchain. When two parties decide to enter a smart contract, they
place some of their own assets under the control of the contract. Every
time somenone wants to take assets out of the contract, the program is
run and only if its output is positive are the assets released.

On the Cardano blockchain, the programs that run on the blockchain are
written in a language called _Plutus Core_. However, smart contract
authors do not write Plutus Core directly. The Plutus Platform is a
software development kit to enable smart contract authors to easily
write smart contracts, including the logic that will eventually be run
on the blockchain as Plutus Core.

In the xref:01-plutus-tx.md#plutus-tx[first tutorial] we will
go over the basics of using Plutus Tx to write smart contract logic.
