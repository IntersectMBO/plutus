== What is Plutus Tx?

Plutus applications are written as a single Haskell program, which describes
both the code that runs off the chain (on a user's computer, or in their
wallet), and on the chain (as part of transaction validation).

The parts of the program that describe the on-chain code are still just Haskell,
but they are compiled into Plutus Core (instead of into the normal compilation
target language) and we refer to them as "Plutus Tx" ("Tx" since they usually
go into transactions).

WARNING: Strictly speaking, only a subset of Haskell is
supported inside Plutus Tx blocks, but the majority of simple Haskell will work,
and the Plutus Tx compiler will tell you if you use something that is unsupported.

The key technique that we use to implement Plutus Tx is called _staged metaprogramming_.
What that means is that the main Haskell program generates _another_ program, in
this case the Plutus Core program that will run on the blockchain. Plutus Tx is
the mechanism that we use to write those programs. But because Plutus Tx is just
part of the main Haskell program we can share types and definitions between the two.

== Template Haskell preliminaries

Plutus Tx makes use of Template Haskell, Haskell's metaprogramming support.
There are a few reasons for this:

. Template Haskell allows us to do work at compile time, which
is when we do Plutus Tx compilation.
. It allows us to wire up the machinery that actually invokes the Plutus Tx compiler.

There are a lot of things you can do with Template Haskell, but we only make
very light usage of it, so we will just cover the basics here.

Template Haskell begins with _quotes_. A
Template Haskell quote is a Haskell expression `e` inside special brackets
`[|| e ||]`. It has type `Q (TExp a)` where `e` has type `a`.
`TExp a` is a _representation_ an expression of type `a`, i.e. the syntax of the
actual Haskell expression which was quoted. The quote lives in the
type `Q` of quotes, which isn't very interesting for us.

NOTE: There is also an abbreviation `TExpQ a` for `Q (TExp a)`, which avoids
some parentheses.

You can _splice_ a quote into your program using the `$$`
operator. This inserts the syntax represented by the quote into the program at
the point where the splice is written.

The effect of this is that quote allow us to talk about Haskell programs as values.

The Plutus Tx compiler compiles Haskell _expressions_ (not values!), so
naturally it takes a quote (representing an expression) as an argument. The
result is a new quote, this time for a Haskell program
that represents the _compiled_ program. In Haskell, the type of  `compile` is
`TExpQ a -> TExpQ (CompiledCode PLC.DefaultUni a)`. This is just what we already said:

- `TExpQ a` is a quoted representing a program of type `a`.
- `TExprQ (CompiledCode PLC.DefaultUni a)` is quote representing a compiled Plutus Core
program.

NOTE: `CompiledCode` has a type parameter `a` as well, which corresponds to the
type of the original expression. This lets us "remember" what the original type
of the Haskell program that we compiled was.

Since `compile` produces a quote, to use the result we need to splice it back
into our program. When you compile the main program, the Plutus Tx compiler will
run and the compiled program will be inserted into the main program.

This is all the Template Haskell you need to know! We almost always use the
same, very simple pattern, which is to make a quote, immediately call `compile`
and then splice the result back in, so once you are used to that you can mostly
ignore it.

Here’s the most basic program we can write: one that just evaluates to
the integer `1`.

NOTE: We've included doctests to the examples that show the Plutus Core that is
generated from compilation. The syntax of Plutus Core will look unfamiliar. This is fine, since it is
the "assembly language" and you won’t need to inspect the output of
the compiler. However, for our purposes it’s
instructive to look at it to get a vague idea of what’s going on.

[source,haskell]
----
integerOne :: CompiledCode PLC.DefaultUni Integer
integerOne = $$(compile -- <.>
    [|| (1 :: Integer) ||]) -- <.> <.>

{- |
>>> pretty $ getPlc integerOne
(program 1.0.0
  (con 1)
)
-}
----
<.> `compile` turns the `TExpQ Integer` into a `TExpQ (CompiledCode PLC.DefaultUni Integer)`,
and the splice inserts the `TExpQ (CompiledCode PLC.DefaultUni Integer)` into the program.
<.> The quote has type `TExpQ Integer`.
<.> We always use unbounded integers in Plutus Core, so we have to pin
down this numeric literal to an `Integer` rather than an `Int`.

We can see how the metaprogramming works here: the Haskell program `1`
was turned into a `CompiledCode PLC.DefaultUni Integer` at compile time, which we
spliced into our Haskell program, and which we can then inspect at
runtime to see the generated Plutus Core (or to put it on the
blockchain).

We also see the standard usage pattern here: a TH quote, wrapped in a call to `compile`,
wrapped in a `$$` splice. This is how we write all of our Plutus Tx
programs.

Here’s a slightly more complex program, namely the identity function on
integers.

[source,haskell]
----
integerIdentity :: CompiledCode PLC.DefaultUni (Integer -> Integer)
integerIdentity = $$(compile [|| \(x:: Integer) -> x ||])

{- |
>>> pretty $ getPlc integerIdentity
(program 1.0.0
  (lam ds (con integer) ds)
)
-}
----

== Functions and datatypes

You can use functions inside your expression. In practice, you
will usually want to define the entirety of your Plutus Tx program as a
definition outside the quote, and then simply call it inside the quote.

[source,haskell]
----
{-# INLINABLE plusOne #-} -- <.>
plusOne :: Integer -> Integer
plusOne x = x `addInteger` 1 -- <.>

{-# INLINABLE myProgram #-}
myProgram :: Integer
myProgram =
    let
        plusOneLocal :: Integer -> Integer -- <.>
        plusOneLocal x = x `addInteger` 1

        localTwo = plusOneLocal 1
        externalTwo = plusOne 1
    in localTwo `addInteger` externalTwo

functions :: CompiledCode PLC.DefaultUni Integer
functions = $$(compile [|| myProgram ||])

{- |
>>> pretty $ unsafeEvaluateCk $ toTerm $ getPlc functions -- <.>
(con 4)
-}
----
<.> Functions which will be used in Plutus Tx programs should be
marked with GHC’s `INLINABLE` pragma.
This is usually necessary for non-local functions to
be usable in Plutus Tx blocks, as it instructs GHC to keep the
information that the Plutus Tx compiler needs. While you may be able
to get away with omitting it, it is good practice to always include it.
<.> `addInteger` comes from `Language.PlutusTx.Builtins`, and is
mapped to the builtin integer addition function in Plutus Core.
<.> Local functions do not need to be marked as `INLINABLE`.
<.> We’ve used the CK evaluator for Plutus Core to evaluate the program
and check that the result was what we expected

We can use normal Haskell datatypes and pattern matching freely:

[source,haskell]
----
matchMaybe :: CompiledCode PLC.DefaultUni (Maybe Integer -> Integer)
matchMaybe = $$(compile [|| \(x:: Maybe Integer) -> case x of
    Just n -> n
    Nothing -> 0
   ||])
----

Unlike functions, datatypes do not need any kind of special annotation to be
used inside a
quote, hence we can use types like `Maybe` from the Haskell `Prelude`.
This works for your own datatypes too!

Here’s a small example with a datatype of our own representing a
potentially open-ended end date.

[source,haskell]
----
-- | Either a specific end date, or "never".
data EndDate = Fixed Integer | Never

-- | Check whether a given time is past the end date.
pastEnd :: CompiledCode PLC.DefaultUni (EndDate -> Integer -> Bool)
pastEnd = $$(compile [|| \(end::EndDate) (current::Integer) -> case end of
    Fixed n -> n `lessThanEqInteger` current
    Never -> False
   ||])
----

We could also have defined the `pastEnd` function as a separate `INLINABLE`
binding and just referred to it in the quote, but in this case it's small enough
to just write in place.

== Typeclasses

So far we have used functions like `lessThanEqInteger` for comparing `Integer` s,
which is much less convenient than `<` from the standard Haskell `Ord` typeclass.

Plutus Tx does support typeclasses, but we need to
redefine the standard typeclasses do so, since we require the class methods to
be `INLINABLE`, and the implementations for types such as `Integer` use the
Plutus Tx builtins.

Redefined versions of many standard typeclasses are available in the Plutus Tx
Prelude. As such you should be able to use most typeclass functions in your Plutus Tx
programs successfully.

For example, here is a version of the `pastEnd` function using `<`. This will be
compiled to exactly the same code as the previous definition.

[source,haskell]
----
-- | Check whether a given time is past the end date.
pastEnd' :: CompiledCode PLC.DefaultUni (EndDate -> Integer -> Bool)
pastEnd' = $$(compile [|| \(end::EndDate) (current::Integer) -> case end of
    Fixed n -> n < current
    Never -> False
   ||])
----

== The Plutus Tx Prelude

The `Language.PlutusTx.Prelude` module is a drop-in replacement for the
normal Haskell Prelude, but with some functions and typeclasses redefined to be easier
for the Plutus Tx compiler to handle (i.e. `INLINABLE`).

You should use the Plutus Tx Prelude whenever you are writing code that you expect to compile with
the Plutus Tx compiler. All of the definitions in the Plutus Tx Prelude have
working Haskell definitions, so you can use them in normal Haskell code too,
although the Haskell Prelude versions will probably perform better.

To use the Plutus Tx Prelude, use the `NoImplicitPrelude` language
pragma, and import `Language.PlutusTx.Prelude`.

Plutus Tx has some builtin types and functions available for working
with primitive data (integers and bytestrings), as well as a few special
functions. These builtins are also exported from the Plutus Tx Prelude.

The `error` builtin deserves a special mention. `error` causes the
transaction to abort when it is evaluated, which one way to trigger
validation failure.

== Lifting values

So far we’ve seen how to define pieces of code _statically_ (when you
_compile_ your main Haskell program), but you are likely to want to generate code
_dynamically_ (when you _run_ your main Haskell program). For example, you
might be writing the body of a transaction to initiate a crowdfunding
smart contract, which would need to be parameterized by data
determining the size of the goal, the campaign start and end times, etc.

We can do this in the same way that we normally parameterize code in functional
programming: we write the static code as a _function_, and we provide the
argument later to configure it.

In our case we have a complication, in that we want to make the argument and
apply the function to it at runtime. Plutus Tx provides a mechanism to do this
called _lifting_. Lifting makes it easy to use the same types
both inside your Plutus Tx program and in the external code that uses
it.

NOTE: When we talk about "runtime" here, we mean the runtime of the main Haskell
program, *not* when the Plutus Core runs on the chain. We want to configure
our code when the main Haskell program runs, as that is when we will be getting
user input.

As a very simple example, let’s write an add-one
function.

[source,haskell]
----
addOne :: CompiledCode PLC.DefaultUni (Integer -> Integer)
addOne = $$(compile [|| \(x:: Integer) -> x `addInteger` 1 ||])
----

Now, suppose we want to apply this to `4` at runtime, giving us a
program that computes to `5`. We need to _lift_ the argument (`4`)
from Haskell to Plutus Core, and then we need to apply the function to
it.

[source,haskell]
----
addOneToN :: Integer -> CompiledCode PLC.DefaultUni Integer
addOneToN n =
    addOne
    `applyCode` -- <.>
    liftCode n -- <.>

{- |
>>> pretty $ getPlc addOne
(program 1.0.0
  [
    (lam
      addInteger
      (fun (con integer) (fun (con integer) (con integer)))
      (lam ds (con integer) [ [ addInteger ds ] (con 1) ])
    )
    (lam
      arg
      (con integer)
      (lam arg (con integer) [ [ (builtin addInteger) arg ] arg ])
    )
  ]
)
>>> let program = getPlc $ addOneToN 4
>>> pretty program
(program 1.0.0
  [
    [
      (lam
        addInteger
        (fun (con integer) (fun (con integer) (con integer)))
        (lam ds (con integer) [ [ addInteger ds ] (con 1) ])
      )
      (lam
        arg
        (con integer)
        (lam arg (con integer) [ [ (builtin addInteger) arg ] arg ])
      )
    ]
    (con 4)
  ]
)
>>> pretty $ unsafeEvaluateCk $ toTerm program
(con 5)
-}
----
<.> `applyCode` applies one `CompiledCode` to another.
<.> `liftCode` lifts the argument `n` into a `CompiledCode PLC.DefaultUni Integer`.

We lifted the argument using the `liftCode` function. In order to use this, a type
must have an instance of the `Lift` class. In practice, you should
generate these with the `makeLift` TH function from
`Language.PlutusTx.Lift`.

NOTE: `liftCode` is a little "unsafe" because it ignores any errors that might occur from
lifting something that isn't supported. There is a `safeLiftCode` if you want to explicitly
handle these.

The combined program applies the original compiled lambda to the lifted
value (notice that the lambda is a bit complicated now since we have
compiled the addition into a builtin).

Here’s an example with our custom datatype. The output is the encoded
version of `False`.

[source,haskell]
----
makeLift ''EndDate -- <.>

pastEndAt :: EndDate -> Integer -> CompiledCode PLC.DefaultUni Bool
pastEndAt end current =
    pastEnd
    `applyCode`
    liftCode end
    `applyCode`
    liftCode current

{- |
>>> let program = getPlc $ pastEndAt Never 5
>>> pretty $ unsafeEvaluateCk $ toTerm program
(abs
  out_Bool (type) (lam case_True out_Bool (lam case_False out_Bool case_False))
)
-}
----
<.> `makeLift` generates instances of `Lift` automatically.
