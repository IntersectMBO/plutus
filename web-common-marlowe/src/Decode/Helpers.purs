-- This is a lazy version of the Alt operator to be used in the context of decoding a Foreign
-- value into a PureScript data type.
-- The problem of using <|> from Control.Alt is that `F a` is defined as an `Except MultipleErrors a`
-- which resolves to `ExceptT MultipleErrors Indentity a`, and the Identity monad is not lazy, so when
-- we do:
-- parseAsX a <|> parseAsY a
-- the value will be parsed eagerly as X and Y before discarding one option.
-- With this helper, the parsers needs to be defined as:
-- parseAsX a <|> \_ -> parseAsY a
-- but then the parseAsY will only be invoked if the parseAsX failed.
