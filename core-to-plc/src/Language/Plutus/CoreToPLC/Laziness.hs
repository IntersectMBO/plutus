{- Note [Object- vs meta-language combinators]
Many of the things we define as *meta*-langugage combinators (i.e. operations on terms) could be defined
as combinators in the object language (i.e. terms). For example, we can define 'delay' as taking a term
and returning a lambda that takes unit and returns the term, or we could define a 'delay' term

\t : a . \u : unit . t

We generally prefer the metalanguage approach despite the fact that we could share combinators
with the standard library because it makes the generated terms simpler without the need for
a simplifier pass. Also, PLC isn't lazy, so combinators work less well.
