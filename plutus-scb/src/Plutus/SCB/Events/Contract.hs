-- $contract-events
-- The events that compiled Plutus contracts are concerned with. For each type
-- of event there is a request constructor in 'ContractRequest' and a response
-- constructor in 'ContractResponse'.
{- Note [Contract Events]

Each contract instance has two event queues in the SCB: One for the requests
it makes, typed 'ContractRequestEvent', and one for the responses it receives,
typed 'ContractResponseEvent'.

The contract instances themselves deal with *sets of active endpoints* instead of
requests and responses directly. When the set of active endpoints of an instance
changes, the SCB needs to translate the change into 'ContractRequestEvent' values
by creating 'IssueRequest' events for the endpoints that have been added (compared
to the previous set of active endpoints) and creating 'CancelRequest' values for
endpoints that have disappeared.
