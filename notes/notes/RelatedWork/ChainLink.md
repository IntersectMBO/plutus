# ChainLink

* [Website](https://www.smartcontract.com/link)
* Integrated with Ethereum, Hyperledger, and Bitcoin and based on an ERC20 token (LINK).


## Purpose

ChainLink is an intermediary (blockchain middleware) between blockchain smart contracts and off-chain entities, such as data feeds, web APIs, and traditional banking APIs. ChainLink is realised by a decentralised network of nodes operated by independent contributors who provide off-chain information in exchange for payment in LINK. In contrast to [Augur](Augur.md), information is aggregated off-chain and then only posted on-chain to allow consumption by on-chain contracts. This architecture has been chosen to improve scalability; i.e., be independent of the throughput of the main chain.
