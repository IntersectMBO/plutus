# Experiments with variations on the CEK machine - Appendix

The graphs in [CEK-variations.md](./CEK-variations.md) don't include
the CK machine because doing that usually compresses the informatin
for the CEK machine, which is what we really care about.  For
completeness, here are graphs including the CK machine (using
unsaturated builtins).  In some of the graphs the pink and grey lines
for the two versions of the CK machine coincide, so you can only see
one of them.
