{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

-- This file contains a version of the CEK machine in
-- continuation-passing-style, where the frames and return
-- operation of the original version are replaced with explicit
-- continuations.  The original CEK machine can be seen as a
-- defunctionalised version of this machine.

-- | The CEK machine.
-- Rules are the same as for the CK machine from "Language.PlutusCore.Evaluation.CkMachine",
-- except we do not use substitution and use environments instead.
-- The CEK machine relies on variables having non-equal 'Unique's whenever they have non-equal
-- string names. I.e. 'Unique's are used instead of string names, so the renamer pass is required.
-- This is for efficiency reasons.
-- The type checker pass is required as well (and in our case it subsumes the renamer pass).
-- Feeding ill-typed terms to the CEK machine will likely result in a 'MachineException'.
-- The CEK machine generates booleans along the way which might contain globally non-unique 'Unique's.
-- This is not a problem as the CEK machines handles name capture by design.
