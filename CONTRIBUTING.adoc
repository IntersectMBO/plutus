== How to develop the code

Make sure you have set up the link:./README{outfilesuffix}#prerequisites[prerequisities].

You can get an environment for developing the entire project using
`nix-shell` in the root directory. This will have all external
dependencies present, so is suitable for building the packages with
e.g. `cabal v2-build`.

NOTE: You may want to consider using https://github.com/target/lorri[lorri] as a
convenient alternative to running `nix-shell` directly.

An environment for developing a particular package in isolation can be
entered by using
`nix-shell default.nix -A haskell.projectPackages.<package name>.components.<component type>.<component name>.env`.
This has all the dependencies, *including* local ones, provided.
This shouldn’t be necessary unless you need to use an old-style
`cabal` command that only works in a single package context.

=== How to setup HIE

Depending on your setup, symlink either `hie-cabal.yaml` or `hie-stack.yaml` to `hie.yaml`.

[WARNING]
====
You can also use `cabal` and `stack` outside a Nix environment to build
the project. _However_ there are two caveats:

* You may get different versions of packages.
** This *shouldn't* happen, but we can't guarantee it.
* We are not currently enabling the Nix integration for these tools, so
they will use your system GHC and libraries, rather than that ones that
will be used by Nix.
** We sometimes patch the GHC that we use in Nix, so
this can at least potentially cause problems or cause you to be missing
bug workarounds.

[[update-generated]]
=== How to update the generated Haskell package set

The Nix code that builds all the Haskell packages and their dependencies is generated automatically.
However, to avoid doing too much work all the time,
we have *pinned* it with the hash of the result of the generation process.

IMPORTANT: This hash needs to be regenerated if you change any dependencies in cabal files
or change the Stackage resolver.

You can find the hash in link:./nix/haskell.nix[`nix/haskell.nix`]. All you need to do is comment out the
`stack-sha256` attribute, and rebuild something. You will see a command on stderr that will tell you
how to generate the replacement hash.

[[update-materialized]]
=== Speed up Nix development by materializing the package set

When you ask Nix to build a haskell package, it recalculates the
Hackage package set to use as an input. Even if this set hasn't
changed, and everything is already available on local disk, the
recalculation itself can take a significant amount of time.

Thankfully we can cache that recalculation using https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell.nix/blob/master/docs/user-guide/materialization.md[haskell.nix's materialization feature]. To do this:

* Build once. Look for the build message that says:

....
trace: To materialize, point `materialized` to a copy of /nix/store/<somehash>-stack-to-nix-pkgs
....

* Note the exact path. Make a local copy of it:

[source,sh]
----
cp -R /nix/store/<somehash>-stack-to-nix-pkgs nix/stack.materialized
----

NOTE: This must be a copy, not a symlink.

* Edit `nix/haskell.nix`. Below the `stack-sha256` attribute add:

[source,sh]
----
  materialized = ./stack.materialized;
----

The next time you build nix should use the materialized package set,
the, "trace: To materialize..." message should disappear and your
build should be noticiably faster.

NOTE: Do not commit these changes! They should only be local to your machine.


[[update-freeze]]
=== How to update `cabal.project.freeze`

The `cabal.project.freeze` file ensures that Cabal users will get the same versions as
are picked by Stack. The way we ensure this is by running `cabal v2-freeze` in a Nix environment
based on the package set generated from the Stack configuration. This ensures that Cabal chooses versions
that match those in the Stackage resolver.

IMPORTANT: This file needs to be regenerated if you change any dependencies in cabal files
or change the Stackage resolver. To regenerate the file, run `nix-shell --run "cabal v2-freeze"` in the root.

[NOTE]
====
The `nix-shell` invocation will *build* all the dependencies of the project, so if you
have just made a substantial change (e.g. changing the snapshot), then you may want to
push your change to a PR so Hydra will build it before doing this step.
====

=== How to update one of our pinned dependencies

==== Haskell pins

We have pinned versions of some Haskell packages specified via the usual `source-repository-package` (Cabal)
and `extra-dep` (Stack) mechanisms.

These can be managed normally, but ensure that:

* The specifications remain in sync between `cabal.project` and `stack.yaml`.
* You update the xref:update-generated[package set sha] and the xref:update-freeze[freeze file].
* If it is an `extra-dep`, you update the `nix-sha256` comment in `stack.yaml`. For the moment you have to do this by hand, using the
following command to get the sha: `nix-prefetch-git --quiet <repo-url> <rev> | jq .sha256`.

==== Nix pins

We pin versions of some git repositories that are used by Nix, for example `nixpkgs`.

These are specified in link:./nix/sources.json[`sources.json`]. This file is managed by
https://github.com/nmattia/niv[`niv`]. You can edit it by hand, but I wouldn't recommend it.
See the `niv` website for usage instructions.

=== How to add a new package to the repository

You need to do a few things when adding a new package, in the following
order:

. Add the cabal file for the new package.
. Add the package to link:stack.yaml[`stack.yaml`].
. Add the package to link:cabal.project[`cabal.project`].
. Update the xref:update-generated[package set sha] and the xref:update-freeze[freeze file].
. Check that you can run `nix build -f default.nix haskell.projectPackages.<package name>`
successfully.
. If the package is from a newer hackage, use `nix-shell -p niv --run "niv update haskell.nix"`
to update the hackage index.

=== Code style

==== Code comments

Extensive code comments are encouraged. If it took you a while to work out how or
why to do something, then write it down so the next person looking at it (which might
be future you) gets some help.

Focus on *why* things are the way they are -- this information is not in the code and
can easily be lost. People can usually work out the *how*, but
it can be good to comment on the odd dangerous bend.

If in doubt, write more. It is unusual that people write too much!

==== "Notes"

We adopt a convention (stolen from GHC) of writing fairly substantial notes in our code
with a particular structure.

The structure is:

* The Note should be in a multiline comment (i.e. `{- -}`)
* The first line of the Note should be `Note [Name of note]`
* Refer to a Note from where it is relevant with a comment saying `See Note [Name of note]`

Notes are a great place to put substantial discussion that you need to refer to from
multiple places. For example, if you used an encoding trick to fit more data into
an output format, you could write a Note describing the trick (and justifying its usage!), and
then refer to it from the encoder and the decoder.

==== Formatting

We use `stylish-haskell` for Haskell code formatting. It is checked by the CI, so
if you don’t apply it them your PR will not go green. To avoid annoyance,
set up your editor to run it automatically.

NOTE: You can run `stylish-haskell` over your tree and apply changes
by running `$(nix-build default.nix -A dev.scripts.fixStylishHaskell)`.

==== Compiler warnings

The CI builds with `-Werror`, so will fail if there are any compiler warnings.

== How to make and review changes

=== How to make commits

There are no enforced policies for making commits.

.Guidelines for committing:
* Set up automatic commit signing.
* The best places for information are 1) in code comments, 2) in a commit message,
3) in a pull request description.
** It doesn't hurt to repeat yourself a little across these media.
* If the commit is small, very focussed, or very obvious then it doesn't need a big message.
* Commit often and rebase/squash later.

=== How to submit a change

All code changes go through pull requests (PRs), it is not possible to push directly to master.

.Guidelines for submitting PRs:
* Make your PR *from* the main repository if possible, this is necessary
for the Buildkite CI to trust you.
** Making a PR from a fork is acceptable, you will need to do this if
you don’t have write access to the main repository.
* PRs exist to be reviewed - design them with a reader in mind!
** Include the ticket name in the PR title where possible.
** Write a helpful PR description that explains what’s in the PR and
why, and draws attention to anything of particular note, references
related tickets etc.
** Consider rebasing your PRs before submitting to structure them into a
few logical commits that can be reviewed separately. Keep PRs to a
single topic.
** If you find yourself making unrelated changes, pull those commits out
into another PR and submit them separately (i.e. do not include them in
the original PR)
** If you can’t remove unrelated changes from your PR (because you
depend on them), then add a note that your PR depends on the other one
and should not be merged before it. You can still put it up for review.
** Take especial care to manage changes that are likely to have many
conflicts (like formatting or refactoring changes) in their own PRs.
* Submit PRs in a "finished" state. If you want to use a PR to let
people review a WIP branch, submit it using Github's "draft PR" feature.
* Take a minute to review the diff when opening a PR -- often you'll spot
a few things that look wrong!
* Use your judgment when requesting review.
* Force-pushing PRs is okay, this will mostly do the right thing in
Github. Do this if you’re applying fixups, or you’ve done a series of
additional commits that you want to squash down before merging.
* Comment if you want attention from someone (e.g. a re-review after
changes). Github does not make it easy to signal this state otherwise,
and people may not be notified if you just push commits.

.Pre-submit checklist:
* `$(nix-build default.nix -A dev.scripts.fixStylishHaskell)` to fix any formatting issues.
* `cabal v2-build all` to check that everything builds.

You can build some things with Nix locally if you like, but it's fine to let the CI do that for you.

=== How to do code reviews

.Guidelines for reviewing PRs:
* Try to review PRs where your review is requested within a few days.
This should be nearly-top-priority work.
* If you don’t understand something then ask for an explanation.
** For the author: this explanation should ideally be added as a comment - you’re
going to write it anyway, and future readers are likely to be
just as confused as the reviewer.

== Continuous integration

We have three CI systems at the moment:
- Hydra
- Hercules
- Buildkite

The CI will report statuses on your PRs with links to the logs in case of
failure. Pull requests cannot be merged without the CI going green.

.Troubleshooting CI
* Because the CI is not necessarily run on
the merge commit that is created when the PR is merged, it is possible
that merging a green PR can result in the CI being broken on master.
This shouldn’t happen frequently, but be aware that it’s possible.
* You can check on the status of your PR on Hydra _before_ it has finished
by going to the https://hydra.iohk.io/project/Cardano[Hydra project page] and searching
for `plutus-pr-<PR number>`.

=== Hydra

Hydra is the "standard" CI builder for Nix-based projects. It builds everything in the project, including
all the tests, documentation, etc.

Hydra builds jobs based on `release.nix`, although currently this imports a lot of its jobs from `ci.nix`
(see Hercules).

Hydra will not report a failed status if `release.nix` has errors, we have a Builkite job to check this.

=== Hercules

Hercules is a new CI builder for Nix-based projects. It has some advantages over Hydra, but for the moment
everything is built on both.

Hercules builds jobs based on `ci.nix`.

=== Buildkite

Buildkite handles any remaining ad-hoc things. At the moment it just runs a script that checks whether the
Hydra build had an evaluation error, and fails if that happened.

== Continuous deployment

The Plutus Playground is continuously deployed to an https://alpha.plutus.iohkdev.io/[alpha environment].
This happens when a PR is merged to master, you can see the status on the
Github https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/deployments[deployments page].
