{- Note [Renaming of mutually recursive bindings]
The 'RenameM' monad is a newtype wrapper around @ReaderT renaming Quote@, so in order to bring
a name into the scope we need to use the following pattern:

    withFreshenedX :: X -> (X -> RenameM renaming c) -> RenameM renaming c

where an 'X' is some value that has names inside and the second argument is a continuation that
expects to receive this value, but with all the names freshened and with the mappings from the
old uniques to the new ones saved. For the latter reason we can't just write

    freshenX :: X -> RenameM renaming X

because if you write

    freshenX x >>= \xFr -> ...

then the mappings from the uniques of 'x' to the uniques of 'xFr' do not exist in @...@.

Two problems arise:

1. If you have a list of @X@s and then an @Y@ and then another list of @Z@s and you need to freshen
   all of those, it's not nice to compose @withFreshened*@ functions at all. In order to make these
   functions composable, we can wrap them in the 'ContT' monad. See e.g. 'renameDatatypeCM' below.
2. Handling of mutually recursive bindings requires to bring a bunch of bindings in scope first and
   only then to rename their RHSs. I.e. one part of a 'ScopedRenameM' computation must be performed
   immediately (brinding names in scope) and the other part must be postponed until all bindings
   are in scope (renaming of RHSs). We will refer to this scheme as "two-stage renaming".

   Hence we have the following pattern:

       renameXCM :: X -> ContT c PLC.ScopedRenameM (PLC.ScopedRenameM X)

   where an 'X' is some value that defines some names and has types/terms that need to be renamed.
   The first 'PLC.ScopedRenameM' is for bringing names (the first stage) in scope and the second
   'PLC.ScopedRenameM' is for performing the renaming (the second stage).
