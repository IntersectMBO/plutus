{- Note [Recursive lets]
We need to define these with a fixpoint. We can derive a fixpoint operator for values
already.

However, we also need to work out how to encode recursion over multiple values simultaneously.
The answer is simple - we pass them through as a tuple.

Overall, the translation looks like this. We convert this:

let rec
  f_1 : t_1 = b_1
  ..
  f_i : t_i = b_i
in
  result

into this:

(\tuple : forall r . (t_1 -> .. -> t_i -> r) -> r .
  let
    f_1 = _1 tuple
    ..
    f_i = _i tuple
  in
    result
)
($fixN i$ (\choose f_1 ... f_i . choose b_1 ... b_i))

where _i is the accessor for the ith component of a tuple.

This scheme is a little complicated - why don't we just pass a function directly to the
fixed tuple that consumes the values? Why do the second round of let-binding?

The answer is that in order to use the tuple we have to provide a result type. If we used
it directly, we would have to provide the type of the *result* term, which we may not know.
Here we merely have to provide it with the types of the f_is, which we *do* know.
