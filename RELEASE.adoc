= Plutus Release Process

== Packages

The following packages are versioned and released:

- `plutus-core`, which provides
* The main library `plutus-core:plutus-core`
* Three executables, `plutus-core:pir`, `plutus-core:plc`, `plutus-core:uplc`
- `plutus-ledger-api`
* The main library `plutus-ledger-api:plutus-ledger-api`
- `plutus-tx`
* The main library `plutus-tx:plutus-tx`
- `plutus-tx-plugin`
* The main library `plutus-tx-plugin:plutus-tx-plugin`

== Version Scheme

All above packages are versioned and released in sync.
That is, whenever one package releases version X, so do all other packages.

We follow https://pvp.haskell.org/[the PVP version scheme] for the packages, where version numbers have a `major.major.minor.patch` pattern with the following semantics:

- A major release (e.g., 3.5.2.1 -> 3.6.0.0 or 4.0.0.0) may contain arbitrary changes to the API (subject to the backwards compatibility requirements described below).
- A minor release (e.g., 3.5.2.1 -> 3.5.3.0) may contain changes such as new features, which technically can be breaking, but are unlikely to cause breakage in practice, and if it does, the fix should be straightforward (e.g., by renaming).
+
A minor release is also allowed to change the observable behaviors of functions that users should not rely on.
For example, if a function returns a list of things and makes no promise on the order of elements in the returned list, then a minor release may change the order.
- A patch release (e.g., 3.5.2.1 -> 3.5.2.2) can only contain such things as simple bug fixes, performance improvements, and documentation updates.

== Release Frequency

We will begin by making a new major or minor release every 4 weeks, and evaluate and adjust the frequency in the future.
Ad-hoc releases can be made upon request.

We only make patch releases for version `x.y.z`, if a cardano-node release candidate depends on `x.y.z.w`, and an issue is found during the node release process that requires patching plutus.
In all other cases, we always start a new major or minor release from master.

== Release Process

Run `./scripts/prepare-release.sh` to manage the release process. 

== Backwards Compatibility with Cardano API

It is a good idea to avoid breaking the latest version of Cardano API in a new Plutus release.
This makes it easy for downstream projects to update Plutus version without needing a new Cardano API release.

For example, suppose we make some improvements to `plutus-tx-plugin` and make a new major release.
Since all packages are released in sync, we also make a new major release for `plutus-core`.
Although it is a major release, we should avoid making changes that is incompatible with the latest version of Cardano API.
Otherwise, downstream projects such as Plutus Tools won't be able to use the new Plutus version and take advantage of the plugin improvements, until a new Cardano API version is published.

To do so, rather than making changes to the Plutus API that breaks Cardano API (e.g., changing the type of a function), we can temporarily keep both the old Plutus API and the new Plutus API, until a new Cardano API version is released that no longer depends on the old Plutus API.
This is not a hard rule, and does not need to be strictly adhered to if it is too much trouble for small or unclear benefits.

This will not be needed once Cardano API starts to make more frequent releases.

== Participation in the `cardano-node` release process

Some Plutus features and changes require integration testing on devnets and testnets.
Such tests are typically performed by the node QA team or the ecosystem collaborators.
Test scenarios related to the Plutus changes should be reviewed and signed off by the Plutus team.

As stated before, if a bug is found during the node release process that requires fixes in Plutus, we should make a patch release using the process described above, as opposed to a major or a minor one.
That is because we want to minimize the changes to downstream, since this will occur when the Cardano node is already progressing through its release process.
