-- | We can't write instances for type synonyms, and we defined our environment (`Env`) as
-- | a type synonym for convenience. To get around this, we can use `TypeEquals` to assert that
-- | types `a` and `b` are in fact the same.
-- |
-- | In our case, we'll write a `MonadAsk` instance for the type `e`, and assert it is our `Env` type.
-- | This is how we can write a type class instance for a type synonym, which is otherwise disallowed.
