-- | A game with two players. Player 1 thinks of a secret word

--   some funds (the prize) in a pay-to-script transaction output.
--   Player 2 guesses the word by attempting to spend the transaction
--   output. If the guess is correct, the validator script releases the funds.
--   If it isn't, the funds stay locked.

{- Note [Contract endpoints]

A contract endpoint is a function that uses the wallet API to interact with the
blockchain. We can look at contract endpoints from two different points of view.

1. Contract users

Contract endpoints are the visible interface of the contract. They provide a
UI (HTML form) for entering the parameters of the actions we may take as part
of the contract.

2. Contract authors

As contract authors we define endpoints as functions that return a value of
type 'MockWallet ()'. This type indicates that the function uses the wallet API
to produce and spend transaction outputs on the blockchain.

Endpoints can have any number of parameters: 'lock' has two
parameters, 'guess' has one and 'startGame' has none. For each endpoint we
include a call to 'mkFunction' at the end of the contract definition. This
causes the Haskell compiler to generate a schema for the endpoint. The Plutus
Playground then uses this schema to present an HTML form to the user where the
parameters can be entered.
