{- note [Transactions in the crowdfunding campaign]

Assume there is a campaign `c :: Campaign` with two contributors
(identified by public key `pc_1` and `pc_2`) and one campaign owner (pco).
Each contributor creates a transaction, `t_1` and `t_2`, whose outputs are
locked by the scripts `contributionScript c pc_1` and `contributionScript
c pc_1` respectively.

There are two outcomes for the campaign.

1. Campaign owner collects the funds from both contributors. In this case
   the owner creates a single transaction with two inputs, referring to
   `t_1` and `t_2`. Each input contains the script `contributionScript c`
   specialised to a contributor. The redeemer script of this transaction contains the value `Collect`, prompting the validator script to check the
   branch for `Collect`.

2. Refund. In this case each contributor creates a transaction with a
   single input claiming back their part of the funds. This case is
   covered by the `Refund` branch, and its redeemer script is the `Refund` action.

In both cases, the validator script is run twice. In the first case there is a single transaction consuming both inputs. In the second case there are two different transactions that may happen at different times.
