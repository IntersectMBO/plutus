    A simple vesting scheme. Money is locked by a contract and may only be 
    retrieved after some time has passed.

    This is our first example of a contract that covers multiple transactions,
    with a contract state that changes over time.

    In our vesting scheme the money will be released in two _tranches_ (parts):
    A smaller part will be available after an initial number of slots have
    passed, and the entire amount will be released at the end. The owner of the
    vesting scheme does not have to take out all the money at once: They can take out any amount up to the total that has been released so far. The remaining funds stay locked and can be retrieved later.

    Let's start with the data types.

-}

-- | Tranche of a vesting scheme.
data VestingTranche = VestingTranche {
    vestingTrancheDate   :: Slot,
    -- ^ When this tranche is released
    vestingTrancheAmount :: Ada
    -- ^ How much money is locked in this tranche
    } deriving (Generic, ToJSON, FromJSON, ToSchema)

P.makeLift ''VestingTranche

-- | A vesting scheme consisting of two tranches. Each tranche defines a date
--   (slot) after which an additional amount of money can be spent.
data Vesting = Vesting {
    vestingTranche1 :: VestingTranche,
    -- ^ First tranche

    vestingTranche2 :: VestingTranche,
    -- ^ Second tranche

    vestingOwner    :: PubKey
    -- ^ The recipient of the scheme (who is authorised to take out money once 
    --   it has been released)
    } deriving (Generic, ToJSON, FromJSON, ToSchema)

P.makeLift ''Vesting

-- | The total amount of Ada locked by a vesting scheme
totalVested :: Vesting -> Ada
totalVested (Vesting l r _) = Ada.plus (vestingTrancheAmount l) (vestingTrancheAmount r)

    What should our data and redeemer scripts be? The vesting scheme only has a 
    single piece of information that we need to keep track of, namely how much 
    money is still locked in the contract. We can get this information from the 
    contract's transaction output, so we don't need to store it in the data 
    script. The type of our data script is therefore `()`.

    The redeemer script should carry some proof that the retriever of the funds 
    is indeed the `vestingOwner` that was specified in the contract. This proof 
    takes the form of a transaction hash signed by the `vestingOwner`'s private 
    key. For this we use the type 'Ledger.Crypto.Signature'

    That gives our validator script the signature

    `Vesting -> Signature -> () -> PendingTx -> ()`

-}

-- | The validator script
vestingValidator :: Vesting -> ValidatorScript
vestingValidator v = ValidatorScript val where
    val = L.applyScript inner (L.lifted v)
    inner = $$(L.compileScript [|| \(scheme :: Vesting) () (sig :: Signature) (p :: V.PendingTx) ->
        let

            Vesting tranche1 tranche2 owner = scheme
            VestingTranche d1 a1 = tranche1
            VestingTranche d2 a2 = tranche2

            V.PendingTx _ _ _ _ _ range = p
            -- range :: SlotRange, validity range of the pending transaction

            -- We need the hash of this validator script in order to ensure 
            -- that the pending transaction locks the remaining amount of funds 
            -- at the contract address.
            ownHash = $$(V.ownHash) p

            -- The total amount of Ada that has been vested:
            totalAmount :: Ada
            totalAmount = $$(ATH.plus) a1 a2

            -- It will be useful to know the amount of money that has been 
            -- released so far. This means we need to check the current slot 
            -- against the slots 'd1' and 'd2', defined in 'tranche1' and 
            -- 'tranche2' respectively. But the only indication of the current 
            -- time that we have is the 'range' value of the pending 
            -- transaction 'p', telling us that the current slot is one of the 
            -- slots contained in 'range'.
            --
            -- We can think of 'd1' as an interval as well: It is 
            -- the open-ended interval starting with slot 'd1'. At any point 
            -- during this interval we may take out up to 'a1' Ada.
            d1Intvl = $$(Interval.from) d1

            -- Likewise for 'd2'
            d2Intvl = $$(Interval.from) d2

            -- Now we can compare the validity range 'range' against our two 
            -- intervals. If 'range' is completely contained in 'd1Intvl', then 
            -- we know for certain that the current slot is in 'd1Intvl', so the
            -- amount 'a1' of the first tranche has been released.
            inD1Intvl = $$(Slot.contains) d1Intvl range

            -- Likewise for 'd2'
            inD2Intvl = $$(Slot.contains) d2Intvl range

            released :: Ada
            released
                -- to compute the amount that has been released we need to 
                -- consider three cases:

                -- If we are in d2Intvl then the current slot is greater than 
                -- or equal to 'd2', so everything has been released:
                | inD2Intvl = totalAmount

                -- If we are not in d2Intvl but in d1Intvl then only the first
                -- tranche 'a1' has been released:
                | inD1Intvl = a1

                -- Otherwise nothing has been released yet
                | True      = $$(ATH.zero)

            -- And the following amount has not been released yet:
            unreleased :: Ada
            unreleased = $$(ATH.minus) totalAmount released

            -- To check whether the withdrawal is legitimate we need to
            -- 1. Ensure that the amount taken out does not exceed the current 
            --    limit
            -- 2. Compare the provded signature with the public key of the 
            --    vesting owner
            -- We will call these conditions con1 and con2.

            -- con1 is true if the amount that remains locked in the contract 
            -- is greater than or equal to 'unreleased'. We use the 
            -- `adaLockedBy` function to get the amount of Ada paid by pending

    We need three endpoints:

    * 'vestFunds' to lock the funds in a vesting scheme
    * 'registerVestingScheme', used by the owner to start watching the scheme's address
    * 'withdraw', used by the owner to take out some funds.

    The first two are very similar to endpoints we defined for earlier 
    contracts.

vestFunds vst = do
    let amt = Ada.toValue (totalVested vst)

registerVestingScheme vst = startWatching (contractAddress vst)

    The last endpoint, `withdraw`, is different. We need to create a 
    transaction that spends the contract's current unspent transaction output 
    *and* puts the Ada that remains back at the script address.

    -- The signature of 'createTxAndSubmit' is
    -- 'SlotRange -> Set.Set TxIn -> [TxOut] -> m Tx'. So we need a slot range, 
    -- a set of inputs and a list of outputs.

    -- The transaction's validity range should begin with the current slot and 
    -- last indefinitely.

    --
    -- Work that integrates proper cryptographic signatures with public and 
    -- private keys into the emulator is currently ongoing and will result 
    -- in changes to the way signatures are handled in the wallet API. In

    -- If any money is left in the scheme then there will be an additional
