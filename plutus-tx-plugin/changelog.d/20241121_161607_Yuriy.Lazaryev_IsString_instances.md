### Added

- `instance IsString BuiltinByteStringUtf8` allows using string literals to construct UTF8-encoded `BuiltinByteString` values.

- `instance IsString BuiltinByteStringHex` allows using string literals to construct Base16-encoded (aka HEX) `BuiltinByteString` values.

### Removed

- `instance IsString TokenName` as it wasn't compilable by the plutus-tx-plugin anyway. 
- `instance IsString CurrencySymbol` as it wasn't compilable by the plutus-tx-plugin anyway.
