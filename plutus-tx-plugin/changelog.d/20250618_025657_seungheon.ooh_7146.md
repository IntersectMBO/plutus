### Added
- `generate-callstack` option: When enabled, the plugin replaces every occurrence of `PlutusTx.Trace.callStack` with a `BuiltinString` containing the callstack at that relative point. Enabling this option incurs execution-cost overhead: it adds an extra callstack argument to all user-defined functions, and every time they are invoked it requires having extra application node for providing the current callstack. When `gennerate-callstack` is not enabled, `PlutusTx.Trace.callStack` is string "<CallStack>".
