### Changed

- Compiliation will fail if `GADTs` or `PolyKinds` is used in the module. This is to providing better compilation error message. This also encourages clearer onchain/offchain separation by encouraging offchain components that uses `GADTs` or `PolyKinds` to be separated into a new module outside of onchain module.
