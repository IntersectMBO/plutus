{- Note [System FC and System FW]
Haskell uses system FC, which includes type equalities and coercions.

PLC does *not* have coercions in particular. However, PLC also does not have a nominal
type system - everything is constructed via operators on base types, so we have no
need for coercions to convert between newtypes and datatypes.

-- Literals and primitives

{- Note [Literals]
GHC's literals and primitives are a bit of a pain, since they not only have a Literal
containing the actual data, but are wrapped in special functions (often ending in the magic #).

This is a pain to recognize.
-}

{- Note [unpackFoldrCString#]
This function is introduced by rewrite rules, and usually eliminated by them in concert with `build`.

However, since we often mark things as INLINABLE, we get pre-optimization Core where only the
first transformation has fired. So we need to do something with the function.

- We can't easily turn it into a normal fold expression, since we'd need to make a lambda and
  we're not in 'CoreM' so we can't make fresh names.
- We can't easily translate it to a builtin, since we don't support higher-order functions.

So we use a horrible hack and match on `build . unpackFoldrCString#` to "undo" the original rewrite
rule.
-}

{- Note [Addr#]
String literals usually have type `Addr#`. This is not very nice for us, since we certainly don't have
those.

However, they should only appear wrapped by an `unpackCString#` or similar. Except if the string literal
gets lifted out by GHC! This is no problem for our compiler, we will just compile the literal as a binding
and put in a reference... except that the binding would need to be of type `Addr#`.

So we use another horrible hack and pretend that `Addr#` is `String`, since we treat `unpackCString#` as doing nothing.

isProbablyBytestringEq _ = False

{- Note [GHC runtime errors]
GHC has a number of runtime errors for things like pattern matching failures and so on.

We just translate these directly into calls to error, throwing away any other information.
-}

{- Note [Uses of Eq]
Eq can pop up in some annoying places:
- Literal patterns can introduce guards that use == from Eq
- Users can just plain use it instead of our Eq

This typically then leads to things we can't compile.

So, we can try and give an error when people do this. The obvious thing to do is to give an
error if we see a method of Eq. However, this doesn't work since the methods often get
inlined before we see them, either by the simplifier pass we run on our own module, or
because the simplifier does at least gentle inlining on unfoldings from other modules
before we see them.

So we have a few special cases in addition to catch things that look like inlined Integer or
ByteString equality, since those are especially likely to come up.
-}

{- Note [At patterns]
GHC handles @-patterns by adding a variable to each case expression representing the scrutinee
of the expression.

We handle this by simply let-binding that variable outside our generated case.

However, there is a subtlety: we'd like this binding to be removed by the dead-binding removal pass in PIR,
but only where we don't absolutely need it to be sure the scrutinee is evaluated. Fortunately, provided
we do a pattern match at all we will evaluate the scrutinee, since we do pattern matching by applying the scrutinee.

So the only case where we *need* to keep the binding in place is the case described in Note [Default-only cases].
In this case we make a strict binding, in all others we make a non-strict binding.
-}

{- Note [Default-only cases]
GHC sometimes generates case expressions where there is only a single alternative, which is a default
alternative. It can do this even if the argument is a type variable (i.e. not known to be a datatype).
What this amounts to is ensuring the expression is evaluated - hence once place this appears is bang
patterns.

We can't actually compile this as a pattern match, since we need to know the actual type to do that.
But in the case where the only alternative is a default alternative, we don't *need* to, because it
doesn't actually inspect the contents of the datatype. So we can just compile this by returning
the body of the alternative.
-}

{- Note [Coercions and newtypes]
GHC is keen to put coercions in, they're usually great for it. However, this is a pain for us, since
you can have all kinds of fancy coercions, like coercions between functions where some of the arguments
are newtypes. We don't need to support all the stuff you can do with coercions, but we do want to
support newtypes.

A previous approach was to inspect coercions to try and work out if they were coercions between a newtype
and its underlying type, and if so manually construct/deconstruct it. This had a number of disadvantages.
- It only worked on very specific cases (e.g. if the simplifier gets loose it can make more complicated
  coercions that we can't obviously deconstruct without much more work)
- It wasn't future-proof. It's likely that GHC will move in the direction of getting rid of the structure
  of coercions (see https://gitlab.haskell.org//ghc/ghc/issues/8095#note_108189), so this approach might
  well stop working in the future.

So we would like to "believe" coercions, for at least some cases. We can
do this by always treating a newtype as it's underlying type. Except - this doesn't work for recursive
newtypes (we loop!). GHC doesn't have this problem because it treats the underlying type and the
newtype as separate types that happen to have the same representation. We don't have a separate representation
so we don't have that option.

So for the moment we:
- Treat newtypes as their underlying type.
- Blackhole newtypes when we start converting them so we can bail if they're recursive.
- Always believe coercions (i.e. just treat casts as the identity).

The final point could get us into trouble with fancier uses of coercions (since we will just accept them),
but those should fail when we typecheck the PLC. And we explicitly say we don't support such things.
-}

{- Note [Unfoldings]
GHC stores the current RHS of bindings in "unfoldings". These are used for inlining, but
also generally provide the compiler's view of the RHS of a binding. They are usually available
for other modules in the same package, and can be available cross-package if GHC decides it's
a good idea or if the binding is marked INLINABLE (or if you use `-fexpose-all-unfoldings`).

We use unfoldings to get the definitions of non-locally bound names. We then hoist these into
definitions using PIR's support for definitions. This allows a relatively direct form of code
reuse - provided that the code you are reusing has unfoldings! In practice this means you may
need to scatter some INLINABLE pragmas around, but we may be able to improve this in future,
see e.g. https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/10871.

(Since unfoldings are updated as the compiler progresses, unfoldings for bindings in other
modules are typically fully-optimized. The exception is the unfoldings for INLINABLE bindings,
which get the *pre* optimization RHS. This is so that rewrite rules can fire. In practice, this
means that we need to be okay getting either.)
-}

{- Note [Non-strict let-bindings]
Haskell is a non-strict language, PLC is a strict language. One place that can show up is in let-bindings.
In particular, a let-binding where the RHS is not value may behave differently.
e.g.
```
let e = error in if x then e else ()
```
In Haskell this is conditionally error, in PLC it is unconditionally error.

These sorts of thing can be written by the user, or generated by GHC.

We solve this by compiling such let-bindings *non-strictly*. That means we delay the body
and force all uses of it. This is a bit overenthusiastic, as it will add overhead to
effect-free let-bindings, but I don't know of an easy way to tell if an expression is pure.

Conveniently, we can just use PIR's support for non-strict let bindings to implement this.
-}

{- Note [String literals]
String literals are a huge pain. Ultimately, the reason for this is that GHC's 'String' type
is transparently equal to '[Char]', it is *not* opaque.

So we can't just replace GHC's 'String' with PLC's 'String' wholesale. Otherwise things will
behave quite weirdly with things that expect 'String' to be a list. (We want to be type-preserving!)

However, we can get from GHC's 'String' to our 'String' using 'IsString'. This is fine:
we turn string literals into lists of characters, and then we fold over the list adding them
into a big string. But it's bad for two reasons:
- We have to actually do the fold.
- The string literal is there in the generated code as a list of characters, which is pretty big.

So we'd really like to recognize the pattern of applying 'fromString' to a string literal, and then
just use the content of the Haskell string literal to make a PLC string literal.

This is very fiddly:
- Sometimes we get the typeclass method application.
    - But we only want to change it when it's targeting the PLC string type, so we need to have
      that type around so we can check.
- Sometimes the selector has been inlined.
    - We can't easily get access to the name of the method definition itself, so instead we mark
      that as INLINE and look for a special function ('stringToBuiltinString') that is in its
      body (which we put inside 'noinline', see Note [noinline hack]).
- Sometimes our heuristics fail.
    - The actual definition of 'stringToBuiltinString' works, so in the worst case we fall back
      to using it and converting the list of characters into an expression.

It's also annoying since this is the first time that we have to look for a marker function inside
the plugin compilation mode, so we have a special function that's not a builtin (in that it doesn't
just get turned into a function in PLC).
