{- Note [Coverage order]
   The order in which `CoverageType` constructors appear in the type determine the order in
   which their respective transformations in `coverageCompile` will be executed. The topmost `CoverageType`
   will be executed first, followed by the second from the top and so on. It is important to either:
   1. Never add coverage transformations that don't commute or
   2. BE VERY CAREFUL!
   Currently we are employing option (1). Please don't change that unless you know what you're doing
   and you've read the code of `coverageCompile` carefully.

            -- fall back on the default sound comparison for names. This is
            -- non-deterministic! But we care even more about not mixing up things

{- Note [Stable name comparisons]
GHC defines `stableNameCmp` which does a good job of being a stable name
comparator across compiles. *However*, it includes, indirectly, the unit
id that a name comes from, including the hash. While this is stable across
compiles of exactly the same thing, it is *not* stable across compiles
in slightly different environments, e.g. with cabal new-build vs with nix.

This matters since that can eventually affect our test output.

We partially fix this by making the comparison less likely to consult the
unstable unit id. We do this by just flipping the order in which we consult
components: normally GHC looks at the unit id first, then the module name, then
the `OccName`. We do it in the opposite order.

While we can still get instability from this, it should now only happen
if we have a binding with the same name in the same module name but from
different units.

We would like to just copy GHC's implementation and tweak it, but it relies
on non-exported data constructors, so we have to write our own. This is mostly
the same, but e.g. we can't look directly at the "sort" of a `Name`.

{- Note [Scopes]
We need a notion of scope, because we have to make sure that if we convert a GHC
Var into a variable, then we always convert it into the same variable, while also making
sure that if we encounter multiple things with the same name we produce fresh variables
appropriately.

We keep the scope in a `Reader` monad, so any modifications are only local.
