{- Note [Mapping builtins]
We want the user to be able to call the Plutus builtins as normal Haskell functions.

To do this, we provide a library of such functions in Haskell, and we define corresponding
functions and types in PIR so that we can translate references to the Haskell functions and
types into references to the PIR ones.

We can then do whatever we need to inside the definitions to line things up with the real builtins.
(See Note [Builtin types and Haskell types])

To do this, we first need a map from the Haskell TH names to the corresponding GHC names
(in fact the TyThings, so we have the types too). Annoyingly, this has to be done in the
GHC Core monad and then passed to us.

This map lets us write code that defines all the builtins (by their TH names), and also to look
up things by their TH names in the few other cases where we need to (mostly where we use specific
known builtins to implement primitives).

This is a bit fragile, since we rely on having all the names that we need, and having them
mapped to the right things (GHC will panic on us if we e.g. get the wrong kind of TyThing for
a name). We should probably revisit this later.
-}

{- Note [Builtin types and Haskell types]
Several of the PLC builtins use types that should (morally) line up with types that we compile from
Haskell (see also Note [Which types map to builtin types?]).
But there is a problem: they use either primitive or Scott-encoded versions of these types,
whereas when we compile them from Haskell they will end up as abstract types, and so the types
won't line up at the call site.

That is, we generate something like this:
(/\ (Integer :: *) .
  (\ addInteger : Integer -> Integer -> Integer .
      <use addInteger>
  )
  (\ x,y : Integer . <builtin addInteger> x y) -- Uh oh, type error, can't show that Integer = <builtin int>!
)
{<builtin int>}

We handle this in two different ways:
- For the types like Bool and Unit which are really algebraic types, and which have constructors etc.
that we care about elsewhere, we insert adaptor code into the definition of the builtin (see note [Mapping builtins]).
- For types like Integer and Bytestring which don't have visible constructors, we can treat them as completely opaque,
and we use a transparent type alias. (Actually we fake the alias by actually just substituting the definition in
everywhere until we have aliases in PIR. Bear this in mind for the examples below.)

Here's how that looks for a primitive that takes Ints and returns a Boolean, assuming we have bound Integer and Bool
already as an alias and an abstract type respectively:
(\ equalsInteger : Integer -> Integer -> Bool .
  <use equalsInteger>
)
(\ x, y : Integer . -- No need to do anything to the arguments, since we're using a transparent alias for Int
  (<builtin equalsInteger> x y) {Bool} True False -- Immediately match the builtin bool into an abstract Bool
)

We *could* do something like the interleaved definitions that we do for datatypes in PIR. Morally this is perhaps the
right thing to do: we should think of Integer and its builtins as a "module" that goes together and where all the definitions
have access to the internals of the other definitions. A datatype definition is then a special case of a module definition.
However, for the moment this would be quite a bit more design work and so we leave it for future work.

For an example of how the "abstract module" approach would look:
(/\ (Integer :: *) .
  (\ addInteger : Integer -> Integer -> Integer . -- Type signature is fine inside the abstraction
      <use addInteger>
  )
)
{<builtin int>}
(\ x,y : <builtin int> . <builtin addInteger> x y) -- No type error any more, abstraction is gone
-}

{- Note [Which types map to builtin types?]
We have (will have) Bool in the default builtin universe. Why do we not map the Haskell Bool type to the
builtin Bool, but rather compile it as a normal ADT?

The advantage of mapping a type to a builtin type is mainly performance:
- We can directly use (potentially optimized) implementations of operations on that type.
- We do not need adaptors to interoperate with builtin functions that use the builtin version of the type.

On the other hand, the advantages of *not* doing this are:
- User-written code that operates on the type as normal (e.g. pattern matching) will work.
    - We could make this work by compiling pattern matching specially for the builtin type, but this means
      more special cases in the compiler (boo). Maybe we can do this generically in future.
- Code that uses these types will also be compilable/runnable if those builtins are not present.

Overall, this means that we only map performance-critical types like Integer and ByteString directly to
builtin types, and the others we compile normally.
-}

{- Note [Builtin terms and values]
When generating let-bindings, we would like to generate strict bindings only for things that are obviously
pure, and non-strict bindings otherwise. This ensures that we won't evaluate the RHS of the binding prematurely,
which matters if it could trigger an error, or some other effect.

Additionally, strict bindings are a bit more efficient than non-strict ones (non-strict ones get turned into
lambdas from unit and forcing in the body). So we would like to use strict bindings where possible.

Now, we generate bindings for all our builtin functions... but they are not *obviously* pure!
Fortunately, we have a more sophisticated purity check that also detects unsaturated builtin applications,
which handles these cases too.
