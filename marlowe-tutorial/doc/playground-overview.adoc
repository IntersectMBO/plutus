== The Marlowe Playground

This tutorial gives an overview of the Marlowe Playground, an online
tool that allows users to interact with and simulate the operation of
embedded Marlowe contracts. It is available at
{marloweplayground}.


=== Introducing the Marlowe Playground

For Marlowe to be usable in practice, users need to be able to
understand how contracts will behave once deployed to the blockchain,
but without doing the deployment. We can do that by simulating their
behaviour off-chain, interactively stepping through the evaluation of a
contract in the browser-based tool, the Marlowe Playground, a web tool
that supports the interactive construction, revision, and simulation of
smart-contracts written in Marlowe.

*Tabs* and *buttons* in the Playground are shown in bold type below.

We can do this in two different ways, represented by two of the tabs in the tool.

* *HASKELL EDITOR* In this tab we can design and edit an _embedded_ Marlowe contract, using features of Haskell, and then *Compile* it to a pure Marlowe contract, 
* *BLOCKLY* In this tab we can create a a (pure) Marlowe contract using the Blockly visual language; we can then transform it *To Code*.

Whichever approach we used to develop a contract we can then transfer it to the *SIMULATION* tab, in which we can simulate the action of the contract step by step, transaction by transaction taking inputs from participants, observations, and so forth.

We now discuss each of these in more detail.

=== HASKELL EDITOR: developing embedded contracts

The editor supports Haskell development, with syntax highlighting, and
on clicking the *Compile* button the Haskell file will be compiled, and
the top-level definition of `contract` will be evaluated to a pure
Marlowe contract, which is made visible below the Haskell pane. Once we
are happy with the result, we can send it to the simulator pane by
clicking *Send to simulator*.

The figure shows a screenshot of the Marlowe Playground in the middle of
developing an “escrow” contract; other contract examples, based on the
xref:actus-marlowe#actus-marlowe[ACTUS] standard, can be loaded by clicking on
the named *Demos* below the *HASKELL EDITOR* tab.

If you have a github account, it's also possible to save contracts that you develop as _github gists_. To do this log into your account using the  *Log in* button at the top right of the screen. You will then see buttons to allow you to *Publish* or save contracts as gists, and to *Load* contracts from github.

// === BLOCKLY: developing Marlowe contracts visually

// This is covered in the tutorial on link:./escrow_step_by_step.adoc[Escrow step by step].

=== Simulating Marlowe contracts

The second tab in the Marlowe Playground allows users to simulate
Marlowe contracts transaction by transaction. Typically these are either
contracts  developed in the Haskell editor, or within Blockly, but it is also possible to modify the contract under execution, shown in the *Marlowe Contract*
pane at the foot of the page. At each stage in execution, this shows the
contract _still to be executed_.

Other facilities presented by the tool are

* Towards the top of the screen, the *Input Composer* which provides us
with all the actions, choices and observations _that are relevant at
this stage of contract execution_. This smart interface helps us to
validate contracts: are we being offered what we would expect at each
stage in the execution?
* The inputs are gathered in the *Transaction Composer*, where inputs
are sequenced. Again, the interface is smart in only accepting inputs that
can be processed and included in a transaction at this stage of contract execution.
* Once a transaction is composed, it can be applied by choosing the
** *Apply Transaction* button applies the transaction, also
** the *Next Block* button can be applied at any time to advance to the
next block without applying any (more) transactions, 
** the *Undo* button is used to undo the last step, and this can be used to roll back as many steps as you wish, before perhaps trying an alternative path though the contract, and
** the *Reset* button is used to reset the contract and state to their
initial values.
* As the contract is evaluated, the internal state of the system
changes, and this is reflected in the values show in the *State* section
in the middle of the screen. We revisit this below.
* A number of additional demos are available using the buttons to the top right of the _Marlowe Contract_ pane.

=== Building inputs and transactions

We can build our first transaction by selecting the purple plus symbol
`+++` to the left of the potential inputs. If we select the first action
– a deposit by `+alice+` – we see

image:step1.png[Simulation step 1]

where this potential action has disappeared, but it now appears as the first (and only) element in the input list of the transaction. 
If we choose
to apply this transaction, we then see the effect of the deposit by `+alice+`, and
the following changes in the screen.

* The input composer presents a different set of potential inputs, with
the deposit _removed_ and two potential choices given.
* The transaction composer is reset, too.
* The state now shows that there is an active account, and gives its
owner and value.
* The contract itself has also evolved to a `+When+` construct that waits for a
choice. Two choices are possible here: from Alice or from Bob.

image:step2.png[Simulation step 2]

We could then advance to the next block, or indeed a number of steps,
and the current block is shown below the row of four buttons, together with
the amount of money currently deposited in the contract.

Taking another step to reflect that Alice has received the cat from Bob,
Alice and Bob agree and both choose value 0, for “pay”, and make that into a
transaction:

image:step3.png[Simulation step 3]

Applying that transaction makes the contract evolve and to make the payment of
the money to Bob, as is reflected in the state of the Playground in the following image. Note here

* The account belonging to Alice now has a zero balance, 
* the choices made by Alice and Bob are recorded in the state, and
* the payment to Bob has been made.

Moreover the current contract is now `Close`, which has no effect since all the money in the contract has been spent.

image:step4.png[Simulation step 4]

At any point it is possible to _undo_ a step by selecting the *Undo*
button. From the current state, doing this repeatedly will return us to the
position where Alice and Bob are prompted for a choice. If Alice and Bob now make _different_ choices, we reach the following situation, where Carol is asked to choose `0` (for pay) or `1` (for refund):

image:step5.png[Simulation step 5]

After this choice we see this, where Alice is shown to have received her refund:

image:step6.png[Simulation step 6]

At any point in the simulation, as well as being able to *Undo* one step, we can also completely _reset_ the
system to its initial state by pressing the *Reset* button.

====

Use the Marlowe Playground to interact with the `+escrow+` contract in
the various scenarios discussed earlier, in the tutorial on
xref:using-marlowe#using-marlowe[using Marlowe].

Explore making some changes to the contract, and interactions with those
modified contracts.
