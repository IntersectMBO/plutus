{- Note [Skew binary slab lists]
This module implements a very similar structure to the one in 'SkewBinary', but
instead of storing a single value at each node, it instead stores potentially many
values.

The advantage of this is that we can rapidly cons on a collection of values, and that
if we do this regularly then the size of the structure will grow more slowly than
the number of values stored, giving us a discount on our lookup performance (which
depends on the size of the structure!).

The disadvantages are several:
- It's more complex.
- We need another intermediary type, which means more indirect lookups.
- We need to store another size in the spine of the list *and* in the tree nodes,
since a) the structure size no longer tells us the element count, and b) as we
traverse a tree it's no longer true that the size on each side is always half of
the overall size.

Benchmarking suggests that it *is* slightly slower than the normal version
on the non-slab-based workflows, but it's much faster on the slab-based workflows.

So it's not an unqualified win, but it may be better in some cases.
