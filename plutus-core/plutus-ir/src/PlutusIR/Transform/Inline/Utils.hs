{- Note [Renaming strategy]
Since we assume global uniqueness, we can take a slightly different approach to
renaming:  we rename the term we are substituting in, instead of renaming
every binder that our substitution encounters, which should guarantee that we
avoid any variable capture.

We rename both terms and types as both may have binders in them.

{- Note [Inlining and purity]
When can we inline something that might have effects? We must remember that we often also
remove a binding that we inline.

For strict bindings, the answer is that we can't: we will delay the effects to the use site,
so they may happen multiple times (or none). So we can only inline bindings whose RHS is pure,
or if we can prove that the effects don't change. We take a conservative view on this,
saying that no effects change if:
- The variable is clearly the first possibly-effectful term evaluated in the body
- The variable is used exactly once (so we won't duplicate or remove effects)

For non-strict bindings, the effects already happened at the use site, so it's fine to inline it
unconditionally.

TODO: if we are not in conservative optimization mode and we're allowed to move/duplicate
effects, then we could relax these criteria (e.g. say that the binding must be evaluted
*somewhere*, but not necessarily before any other effects), but we don't currently.

{- Note [Inlining criteria]
What gets inlined? Our goals are simple:
- Make the resulting program faster (or at least no slower)
- Make the resulting program smaller (or at least no bigger)
- Inline as much as we can, since it exposes optimization opportunities

There are two easy cases:
- Inlining approximately variable-sized and variable-costing terms (e.g. builtins, other variables)
- Inlining single-use terms

After that it gets more difficult. As soon as we're inlining things that are not variable-sized
and are used more than once, we are at risk of doing more work or making things bigger.
