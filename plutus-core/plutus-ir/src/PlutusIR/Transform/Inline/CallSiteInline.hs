{- Note [Inlining of fully applied functions]

We inline if (1) a function is fully applied (2) its cost and size are acceptable. We discuss
each in detail below.

(1) What do we mean by "fully applied"?

A function is fully applied when it has been applied to all arguments as indicated by its
"syntactic arity":

Consider `let v = rhs in body`, in which `body` calls `v`.

We focus on cases when `v` is a function. (Non-functions have arity () or 0).
I.e., it has type/term lambda abstraction(s). E.g.:

let v = \x1.\x2...\xn.VBody in body

(x1,x2...xn) or n is the syntactic arity of a term. That is, a record of the arguments that the
term expects before it may do some work. Since we have both type and lambda
abstractions, this is not a simple argument count, but rather a list of values
indicating whether the next argument should be a term or a type.

Note that this just corresponds to the number of
syntactic lambda and type abstractions on the outside of the term. It is thus
an under-approximation of how many arguments the term may need.
e.g. consider the term @let id = \x -> x in id@: the variable @id@ has syntactic
arity @[]@, but does in fact need an argument before it does any work.

In the `body`, where `v` is *called*,
if it was given the `n` term or type arguments in the correct order, then it is *fully applied*.
If `VBody` is acceptable in size and cost, we inline the call site of the fully applied `v` in this
case, i.e., we replace `v` in the `body` with `rhs`. E.g.

let f = \x.\y -> x
in
  let z = f q
  in f a b

becomes

let f = \x.\y -> x
in
  let z = f q
  in ((\x.\y -> x) a b)

With beta reduction, it becomes:

let f = \x.\y -> x
in
  let z = f q
  in a (more accurately it becomes (let { x = a, y = b } in x))

This is already a reduction in code size. However, because of this,
our dead code elimination pass is able to further reduce the code to just `a`.

Because a function can be called in the `body` multiple times and may not be fully applied for all
its calls, we cannot simply keep a substitution map like in `Inline`,
which substitute *all* occurrences of a variable. Instead, we store all in scope variables in a
map, `Utils.NonRecInScopeSet`, with all information needed for inlining saturated functions.

To find out whether a function is fully applied, when we encounter a variable in the `body`,
we find its arity from the `Utils.NonRecInScopeSet` map and compare it with the list
of arguments it has been applied to at that site. If it is fully applied, we inline it there.

Note that over-application of a function would also be inlined. E.g.:

```haskell
let id = \y -> y
     f = \x -> id
 in f x y
```

`f`'s arity is (\x) or 1, but is applied to 2 arguments. We inline `f` in this case if its cost and
size are acceptable.

(2) How do we decide whether cost and size are acceptable?

We currently reuse the heuristics 'Utils.sizeIsAcceptable' and 'Utils.costIsAcceptable'
that are used in unconditional inlining. For

let v = \x1.\x2...\xn.VBody in body

we check `VBody` with the above "acceptable" functions.
The "acceptable" functions are currently quite conservative, e.g.,
we currently reject `Constant` (has acceptable cost but not acceptable size).
We will work on more refined checks (e.g., checking their sizes instead of just rejecting them) to
improve the optimization.
