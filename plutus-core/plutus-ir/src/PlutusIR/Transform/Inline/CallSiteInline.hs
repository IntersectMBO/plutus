{- Note [Inlining and beta reduction of functions]

We inline if its cost and size are acceptable.

For size, we compare the sizes (in terms of AST nodes before and after the inlining and beta
reduction), and inline only if it does not increase the size. In the above example, we count
the number of AST nodes in `f a b` and in `a`. The latter is smaller, which means inlining
reduces the size.

We care about program size increases primarily because it
affects the size of the serialized script, which appears on chain and must be paid for.
This is different to many compilers which care about this also because e.g. larger ASTs
slow down compilation. We care about this too, but the serialized size is the main driver for us.

The number of AST nodes is an approximate rather than a precise measure. It correlates,
but doesn't directly map to the size of the serialised script. Different kinds of AST nodes
may take different number of bits to encode; in particular, a `Constant` node always
counts as one AST node, but the constant in it can be of arbitrary size. Then, would it be
better to use the size of the serialised term, instead of the number of AST nodes? Not
necessarily, because other transformations, such as CSE, may change the size further;
specifically, if a large constant occurs multiple times in a program, it may get CSE'd.

In general there's no reliable way to precisely predict the size impact of an inlining
decision, and we believe the number of AST nodes is in fact a good approximation.

For cost, we check whether the RHS (in this example, `\x. \y -> x`) has a small cost.
If the RHS has a non-zero arity, then the cost is always small (since a lambda or a type
abstraction is already a value). This may not be the case if the arity is zero.

For effect-safety, we require: (1) the RHS be pure, i.e., evaluating it is guaranteed to
not have side effects; (2) all arguments be pure, since otherwise it is unsafe to
perform beta reduction.
