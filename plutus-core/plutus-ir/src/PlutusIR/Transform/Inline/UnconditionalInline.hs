An inlining pass.

Note that there is (essentially) a copy of this in the UPLC inliner, and the two
should be KEPT IN SYNC, so if you make changes here please either make them in the other
one too or add to the comment that summarises the differences.

{- Note [Inlining approach and 'Secrets of the GHC Inliner']
The approach we take is more-or-less exactly taken from 'Secrets of the GHC Inliner'.

Overall, the cause of differences is that we are largely trying to just clean up some
basic issues, not do serious optimization. In many cases we've already run the GHC simplifier
on our input!

We differ from the paper a few ways, mostly leaving things out:

Functionality
------------

CallSiteInline: TODO in PLT-1146

Inlining recursive bindings: not worth it, complicated.

Context-based inlining: TODO

Dead code elimination: done in `DeadCode.hs`.

Beta-reduction: done in `Beta.hs`.

Implementation
--------------

In-scope set: we don't bother keeping it, since we only ever substitute in things that
don't have bound variables.

Suspended substitutions ('SuspEx') for values: we don't need it, because we simplify the RHS before
preInlineUnconditional. For GHC, they can do more simplification in context, but they only want to
process the binding RHS once, so delaying it until the call site is better
if it's a single-occurrence term. But in our case it's fine to leave any improved in-context
simplification to later passes, so we don't need this complication.

Optimization after substituting in DoneExprs: we can't make different inlining decisions
contextually, so there's no point doing this.

{- Note [The problem of inlining destructors]
Destructors are *perfect* candidates for inlining:

1. They are *always* called fully-saturated, because they are created from pattern matches,
which always provide all the arguments.
2. They will reduce well after being inlined, since their bodies consist of just one argument
applied to the others.

Unfortunately, we can't inline them even after we've eliminated datatypes, because they look like
this (see Note [Abstract data types]):

(/\ ty :: * .
  ...
  -- ty abstract
  \match : <destructor type> .
    <user term>
)
<defn of ty>
...
-- ty concrete
<defn of match>

This doesn't look like a let-binding because there is a type abstraction in between the lambda
and its argument! And this abstraction is important: the body of the matcher only typechecks
if it is *outside* the type abstraction, so we can't just push it inside or something.

We *could* inline 'ty', but this way lies madness: doing that consistently would mean inlining
the definitions of *all* datatypes, which would enormously (exponentially!) bloat the types
inside, making the typechecker (and everything else that processes the AST) incredibly slow.

So it seems that we're stuck. We can't inline destructors in PIR.

But we *can* do it in UPLC! No types, so no problem. The type abstraction/instantiation will
turn into a delay/force pair and get simplified away, and then we have something that we can
inline. This is essentially the reason for the existence of the UPLC inlining pass.
-}

{- Note [Inlining and global uniqueness]
Inlining relies on global uniqueness (we store things in a unique map), and *does* currently
preserve it because we don't currently inline anything with binders.

If we do start inlining things with binders in them, we should probably try and preserve it by
doing something like 'The rapier' section from the paper. We could also just bite the bullet
and rename everything when we substitute in, which GHC considers too expensive but we might accept.

{- Note [Removing inlined bindings]
We *do* remove bindings that we inline (since we only do unconditional inlining). We *could*
leave this to the dead code pass, but it's helpful to do it here.
Crucially, we have to do the same reasoning wrt strict bindings and purity
(see Note [Inlining and purity]):
we can only inline *pure* strict bindings, which is effectively the same as what we do in the dead
code pass.

Annoyingly, this requires us to redo the analysis that we do for the dead binding pass.
TODO: merge them or figure out a way to share more work, especially since there's similar logic.
This might mean reinventing GHC's OccAnal...

{- Note [Renaming strategy]
Since we assume global uniqueness, we can take a slightly different approach to
renaming:  we rename the term we are substituting in, instead of renaming
every binder that our substitution encounters, which should guarantee that we
avoid any variable capture.

We rename both terms and types as both may have binders in them.
