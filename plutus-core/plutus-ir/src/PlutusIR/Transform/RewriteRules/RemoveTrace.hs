{- Note [Impure trace messages]

Removing of traces could change behavior of those programs that use impure trace messages
e.g. `trace (error ()) foo`.

While it is possible to force evaluation of a trace message when removing a trace call
for the sake of a behavior preservation, this has a downside that pure messages remain
in the program and are not elimitated as a "dead" code.

This downside would defeat the purpose of removing traces, so we decided to not force.
