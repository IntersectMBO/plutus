{- Note [Float-in]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Which bindings can be floated in?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Strict bindings whose RHSs are impure should never be moved, since they can change the
semantics of the program. We can only move non-strict bindings or strict bindings
whose RHSs are pure.

We also need to be very careful about moving a strict binding whose RHS is not a work-free
(though pure). Consider a strict binding whose RHS is a pure, expensive application. If we
move it into, e.g., a lambda, its RHS may end up being evaluated more times. Although this
doesn't change the semantics of the program, it can make it much more expensive. For
simplicity, we do not move such bindings either.

In the rest of this Note, we may simply use "binding" to refer to either a non-strict
binding, or a strict binding whose RHS is work-free. Usually there's no need to distinguish
between these two, since `let x (nonstrict) = rhs` is essentially equivalent to
`let x (strict) = all a rhs`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. The effect of floating in
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If we only float in bindings that are either non-strict, or whose RHSs is a work-free, then
why does that make a difference? Because such bindings are not completely free: when we
move a non-strict binding `let x (nonstrict) = rhs`, what we are really moving around is
`delay rhs`, lambda abstractions and lambda applications. None of them is free because
they incur CEK machine costs.

Here's a concrete example where floating a non-strict binding inwards saves cost:

let a (nonstrict) = rhs in if True then t else ..a..

Without floating `a` into the `else` branch, it is compiled into (in pseudo-UPLC)

[(\a -> if True then t else ..a..) (delay rhs)]

If we float `a` into the `else` branch, then it is compiled into

if True then t else [(\a -> ..a..) rhs]

Since the `else` branch is not taken, the former incurs additional `LamAbs`, `Apply`
and `Delay` steps when evaluated by the CEK machine. Note that `rhs` itself is
evaluated the same number of times (i.e., zero time) in both cases.

And floating a binding inwards can also increases cost. Here's an example:

let a (nonstrict) = rhs in let b (nonstrict) = a in b+b

Because `b` is non-strict and occurs twice in the body, floating the definition of `a` into
the RHS of `b` will incur one more of each of these steps: `Delay`, `LamAbs` and `Apply`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. When can floating-in increase costs?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Floating-in a binding can increase cost only if the binding is originally outside of `X`,
and is floated into `X`, and `X` satisfies both of the following conditions:

(1) `X` is a lambda abstraction, a type abstraction, or the RHS of a non-strict binding
(recall that the RHS of a non-strict binding is equivalent to a type abstraction).

(2) `X` is in the RHS of a (either strict or non-strict) binding whose LHS is used more than once.

Note the "only if" - the above are the necessary conditions, but not sufficient. Also note
that this is in the context of the float-in pass itself. Floating a binding in /can/ affect
ther subsequent optimizations in a negative way (e.g., inlining).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Implementation of the float-in pass
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This float-in pass is a conservative optimization which tries to avoid increasing costs.
The implementation recurses into the top-level `Term` using the following context type:

data FloatInContext = FloatInContext
    { _ctxtInManyOccRhs :: Bool
    , _ctxtUsages       :: Usages.Usages
    }

`ctxtUsages` is the usage counts of variables, and `ctxtInManyOccRhs` is initially `False`.
`ctxtInManyOccRhs` is set to `True` if we descend into:

(1) The RHS of a binding whose LHS is used more than once
(2) The argument of an application, unless the function is a LamAbs whose bound variable
is used at most once, or a Builtin.

The value of `ctxtInManyOccRhs` is used as follows:

(1) When `ctxtInManyOccRhs = False`, we avoid descending into the RHS of a non-strict binding
whose LHS is used more than once, and we descend in all other cases;
(2) When `ctxtInManyOccRhs = True`, we additionally avoid descending into `LamAbs` or `TyAbs`.
