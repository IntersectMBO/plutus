{- Note [Purity, strictness, and variables]
Variables in PLC won't have effects: they can have something else substituted for them,
but those will be fully evaluated already.
However, in PIR we have non-strict variable bindings.
References to non-strict variables *can* have effects - after all,
they compile into an application.

So we need to take this into account in our purity calculation.
We require the user to tell us which variables are strict, this
must be *conservative* (i.e. if you don't know, it's non-strict).
