{- Note [Retained size analysis]
WARNING: everything in this module assumes global uniqueness of variables.

For calculating the size that each binding retains we use a classic graph algorithm for dominance.
The @algebraic-graphs@ library does not provide one out of the box, so we convert an algebraic graph
to a @fgl@-based representation and use the @dom-lt@ library for calculating the dominator tree
(note that @fgl@ itself has an algorithm for dominance [1], but that was only found out after
everything below was implemented, plus that algorithm does not return a 'Tree', so it's not as
convenient to use).

The procedure for computing the retained size of each binding is two-staged:

1. First we compute how much size each let-binding in a term retains directly.
   For example, a 'TermBind' directly retains only the type signature and the body of the binding.
2. Then we compute the dominator tree for the dependency graph of the term and annotate it with the
   retained size of each binding by adding up the directly retained size of the binding computed at
   stage one and the size retained by all the dependencies of the binding

We don't make any assumptions as to whether, say, a constructor of a data type directly retains the
entire data type (its other constructors, the kind signature of the data type etc). Instead, we
specify that each constructor directly retains only its type signature, each parameter directly
retains only its kind signature etc and we let dependency and dominator tree analysis figure out
whether the constructor in fact retains the entire data type by virtue of the constructor being
connected (or not connected) with other parts of the data type. This has a funny effect: if only
one constructor of the data type is actually used, then it's closer to the root of the dependency
graph and so every other part of the data type is considered a dependency (due to them all being
interconnected) and so that constructor gets annotated with the size of the whole data type, while
every other constructor is only annotated with the size that it directly retains (i.e. the size of
its type signature).

Our main motivation for implementing retained size analysis is to calculate what bindings retain
most size, so that we can prioritize certain optimization passes, however we mostly care about the
size of the final untyped program and given that we do take types and kinds into account during
retained size analysis, results do not translate directly to the untyped setting. So beware of this
pitfall.

Even the most efficient dominator tree algorithms are still not linear and our programs are quite
huge, so before jumping into computing the dominator tree we filter the dependency graph and remove
from it everything that does not directly retain any size, i.e. everything that is not a let-binding.
For example, the dependency graph contains lambda-bound variables and we filter them out as they're
irrelevant for computing dominance. So we're relying on the fact that nodes that don't retain any
size are also not interesting for dominator analysis. Which might be wrong. An example is needed.

{- Note [Handling the root]
The dominator tree algorithm works on the assumption that each node is an 'Int'. It's easy to
convert the 'Unique' of a variable to an 'Int', but the dominator tree algorithm needs a root to
walk from and that root also has to be an 'Int' and our uniques start from zero, so we made an
awkward decision to assign the root @-1@ as its index.

Given that the root appears in the dominator tree, we also need to specify the size that it directly
retains. But there doesn't seem to be a sensible way of doing that. Should it be

    rootSize :: Term tyname name uni fun ann -> Size
    rootSize (Let _ _ _ term) = rootSize term
    rootSize term             = termSize term

? But what about bindings inside the final non-let term? However we don't need that directly
retained size of the root for anything that is not "don't throw an error on encountering the root
node that does not correspond to any binding" and since we only annotate bindings, the size retained
by the root is not supposed to appear in the final annotated term anyway, so we just make the root
directly retain some ridiculously huge _negative_ number. Now if it ends up being in the final term,
we know there's a bug somewhere and if it doesn't, we don't care about it.
