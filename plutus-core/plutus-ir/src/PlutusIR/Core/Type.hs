The serialized version of Plutus-IR will be included in  the final
executable for helping debugging and testing and providing better error
reporting. It is not meant to be stored on the chain, which means that
the underlying representation can vary. The `Generic` instances of the
terms can thus be used as backwards compatibility is not required.

{- Note [PIR as a PLC extension]
PIR is designed to be an extension of PLC, which means that we try and be strict superset of it.

The main benefit of this is simplicity, but we hope that in future it will make sharing of
theoretical and practical material easier. In the long run it would be nice if PIR was a "true"
extension of PLC (perhaps in the sense of "Trees that Grow"), and then we could potentially
even share most of the typechecker.
-}

{- Note [Declarations in Plutus Core]
In Plutus Core declarations are usually *flattened*, i.e. `(lam x ty t)`, whereas
in Plutus IR they are *reified*, i.e. `(termBind (vardecl x ty) t)`.

Plutus IR needs reified declarations to make it easier to parse *lists* of declarations,
which occur in a few places.

However, we also include all of Plutus Core's term syntax in our term syntax (and we also use
its types). We therefore have somewhat inconsistent syntax since declarations in Plutus
Core terms will be flattened. This makes the embedding obvious and makes life easier
if we were ever to use the Plutus Core AST "for real".

It would be nice to resolve the inconsistency, but this would probably require changing
Plutus Core to use reified declarations.
