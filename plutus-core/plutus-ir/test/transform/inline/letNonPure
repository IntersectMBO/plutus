y is impure. x occurs more than once and so it would not be inlined by unconditional inlining.
y occurs only once so it gets inlined by unconditional inlining.
x is then not "acceptable" because it's an application, so it doesn't get inlined by call site
inlining. 

let ~y = trace "hello" 1
    !x = y -- so it looks small enough to inline
in addInteger x x
