funApp gets inlined because it only occurs once.
k should not get inlined by the unconditional inline optimization because it occurs more
than once.
Both instances of k should get inlined.
The first instance of k being inlined verifies that the inliner works with type applications.

We have a [tmArg, tmArg, tyArg, tyArg] applying to k's which requires [ty,tm].
