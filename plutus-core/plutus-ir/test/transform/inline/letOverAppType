{- 
funApp gets inlined because it only occurs once.
k should not get inlined by the unconditional inline optimization because it occurs more
than once.
Both instances of k should get inlined by the optimization that inlines fully applied functions 
because it is fully applied.
The first instance of k being inlined verifies that an over-applied function still gets inline with
type applications.
