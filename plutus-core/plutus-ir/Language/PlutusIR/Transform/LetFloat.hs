{- Note [Float algorithm]
The goal of this PIR->PIR transformation is to float lets to their closest-surrounding lambda/Lambda abstraction or
let-effectful and potentially merge adjacent lets into let-groups for
better readability of the program's IR (and potentially reveal any later code optimizations).

Each let-binding is moved right underneath its closest-surrounding lambda/Lambda abstraction or let-effectful (or at toplevel in case of no surrounding lambdas/lets).
Afterwards, all let-bindings belonging to the same lambda/Lambda are merged into 1 or more let-groups. The ordering of
the generated let-groups under a lambda/Lambda is determined by the dependency-graph of the program's IR. The cardinality of the generated let-groups
is determined both by the order of already-generated let-groups of the same level (thus by the dependency-graph) and secondly by the lets' original recursivity
(we do not merge originally-recursive lets).

Note that we do not move (float) those let-bindings which are strict and their RHS is a non-value term. This is needed to preserve the denotational semantics of
the original PIR program, as can be seen in the wrong-floated counter-example:

original: let nonstrict x =
                let y = error in y
          in 1
=> wrongly-floated: let y = error
                 in let nonstrict x = y
                 in 1

Specifically the algorithm is done in two passes:


1st-pass: Traverses an IR term/program and for each let, marks the location of its closest-surrounding lambda or let-nonstrictvalue (or Top if no lambda),
and stores it into a mapping of let-name=>lambda/let-location. We call the closest-surrounding lambda/let-location the *Rank* of a let.
We have an extra pass that cleans a PIR term from all those lets that are *not* let-effectful; see Note [Cleaning lets].

2nd-pass: Traverses the cleaned-up term to place the removed lets back again, this time  directly under their "Rank".
During traversal, when a lambda-location of interest is reached (i.e. Rank),
the algorithm consults the dependency graph to figure (a) the groupings of lets
into let-groups based on their (mutual) recursivity (by utilizing the SCCs of the depgraph)
and (b) the correct code-generation *order* of the let-groups (by utilizing the topsort of the SCCs).
As an optimization, the algorithm merges adjacent *nonrec* let-groups into a single-group for better readability; this is possible
because letnonrec in PlutusIR is linearly scoped.

Example 1 (floating to the closest-surrounding lambda):

\ x -> 1 + (2 * let i = 3 in i+4)
==>
\ x -> let i = 3 in 1 + (2 * i+4)

Example 2 ( merging adjacent let-nonrecs):

\ x -> letnonrec nonstrict x = 1 in letnonrec nonstrict y = 2 in x + y
===>
\ x -> letnonrec nonstrict {x=1; y=2} in x + y


Invariants for the algorithm:

a) Does not float lets outside surrounding lambda/Lambda abstractions/let-effectful.
This has the effect of preserving the nonstrict/strict semantics of the original program.
b) Does not break scoping; only uses the `linear scoping` feature of let-nonrec  to merge adjacent letnonrecs
c) It will not demote a letrec to a letnonrec (however it may promote nonrec to rec as a consequence of rearranging lets)

About (c):
The algorithm may sometimes promote a nonrec to a rec; see for example `plutus-ir/test/transform/letFloat/nonrecToRec.golden`.
This is by design, in the way we use the dependency graph to create the let-groups; the dependency graph
may float upwards some nested let-rhses into an "outside" let-group, and this would require rec.
Example of `let-i` turning from nonrec to rec, by merging with the parent `r` group:

let rec r =
   let nonrec i =
        let nonrec j = r
        in j
   in i

==>

let rec {r = i
         i = let nonrec j = r
             in j
        }

Non-guarantees of the algorithm:

The algorithm does not guarantee that *fewer let-groups* will appear after the transformation,
see for example `plutus-ir/test/transform/letFloat/rec3.golden`. This can happen for two reasons:

i) The algorithm may split a recursive group into multiple groups when it sees that there are no dependencies between certain subgroups,
which is a side-effect of relying on the dependency-graph for determining the let-grouping
ii) The grouping may even be worsened by the "interleaving"/breaking of letnonrec and letrec groups;
the ordering of generated lets relies on *a* topological sort of the dependency graph. Since there can be many
topological sorts, there might exist a topological sort different than the one used,
which would otherwise yield less (or more) let groups.

{- Note [Cleaning lets]
Prior to floating the lets of a term (i.e. pass2), we clean up the term from (almost) all its `let` constructs, and
store those separately in a LetUniqueId=>RhsTerm table (name RhsTable). This is done by the `removeLets` function.
The resulting "cleaned-up" term is most-likely not a valid PIR program anymore because it contains free variables.

The `let` constructs that are not cleaned-up, are the effectful ones:
these lets won't become keys of the output-RhsTable, and thus will not be floated during pass2.
This does not necessarily mean that these effectful-lets will appear in the output cleaned-up term;
they may appear inside the RHS values of the RhsTable (in case they are nested by a to-be-floated, "parent" let),
so their original "absolute" position may still change after pass2 because their parent-let has been floated somewhere else.

In Proceedings of the First ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming, 1-12.

The algorithm of the paper deals with a different source language (Haskell/GHC),
which only has 'letrec' and no support for letnonrec, type-lets, and datatype-lets.

The paper's algorithm can be summarized to:

* The first pass of the term annotates all let-bindings with their ranks (level numbers).
The algorithm collects all the variables that occur free in a let's RHS and their ranks
which were calculated before, at the place where those free variables were defined. The let
is assigned the maximum of those ranks.
* The second pass of the term uses those ranks "to float each binding outward to just
outside the lambda which has a rank (level number) one greater than that on the binding".

## Difference 1 - Rank

For our case, a rank of a let is its closest-surrounding lambda "location" (depth + unique).
In the paper, a rank of a let is calculated as the maximum among the ranks
of the free-variable dependencies that occur in the let's RHS; a rank of a lambda is just its lambda-depth.
The paper's rank includes only the lambda depth and not the lambda-unique.
This is because the lambda-uniques are not needed by the original second pass because
the re-positions of lets are applied "locally" (see Difference - Algorithm).

## Difference - Algorithm

The paper's algorithm applies the float-transformations "locally":
during the second pass, when a let is encountered the algorithm will "decide" at that point to float it outwards or inwards.
This allows more flexibility (heuristics and the possibility to float inwards).

We use a different approach where we prior clean the AST PlutusIR term from all the lets (rec&nonrec)
and store them in a separate 'RhsTable' (see `removeLets` function). We use the information obtained by the dependency graph
to create let-(rec&nonrec) groups at the closest-surrounding lambda location (rank). During
the second pass, whenever we reach a lambda/Lambda definition we float all lets belonging to
this lambda rank (i.e. lambda's depth and unique).
This means that the lets are floated *exactly under* a lambda definition, i.e at the lambda body.

Contrast this with the paper's algorithm, where
lets are floated exactly around the 'expr' that
needs them, and *exactly outside a lambda definition*.
This is because the algorithm stops re-positioning / floating the let-rhs, when it crosses over a lambda with depth
one larger than its calculated rank (level number). Thus, for every lambda rank, a single merged let-group may be generated;
this is no problem for Haskell/GHC, because all lets are letrecs.
The advantage compared to our approach is that the lets will be floated closer to the 'expr' that needs them.
Unfortunately, we cannot use this algorithm in our case for 2 reasons:  a) we cannot float past lambdas/letEffectful because
the language features strict lets and floating would alter the denotational semantics  and b)
in each rank we possibly need to generate multiple let-groups because we have to intersperse between letrecs and letnonrecs.
-}

{- Note [Principal]
In a few structures (the rhstable, the p1data, and the floatdata) we use as a key the unique identifier of a let to store information,
such as the computed rank or the RHS of a let. Since a datatypebind contains multiple declarations, each with its
own identifier (unique), we arbitrarily use one of those (the "principal" identifier) as the index/key for our structures.
This is allowed because the datatypebind declarations of a datatypebind (identifiers) share the same rank and will
"float" altogether as one.

In a previous iteration of the algorithm that used FREE-VARIABLE counting, the "principal" played an extra role:
the intermediate 'p1data' had mappings of each databind declaration's unique to the datatype bind's maximum rank.
e.g. if a datatypebind List had maximum rank `Top`, we added entries List=>Top, a=>Top, Nil=>Top, Cons=>Top.
This was needed because the 'p1data' acted also as a **scope**, so other lets can compute their maximum ranks by looking up their free variables
in the scope -- they couldn't know that an identifier was belonging to what group of identifiers (datatypebind).
At the end of p1, the p1data was transformed to floatdata by removing extraneous datatypebind entries, thus only keeping
the principal identifier entry, as is in the current iteration of the algorithm.
