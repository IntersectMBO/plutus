### Added

- An `apply-to-data` command was added to the `plc` and `uplc` executables which
  allows a script to be applied to a list of flat-encoded data objects (the
  existing `apply` command requires all inputs to be programs).

### Fixed

- The plc and uplc commands were failing to account for the new Constr and Case
  constructors for sums of products.
