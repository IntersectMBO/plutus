### Removed

- `Flat` instances for UPLC terms and programs. These were potentially unsafe as they don't perform the builtin checks that are required on chain, so it is important not to use them by accident. 

### Added

- `UnrestrictedProgram` newtype that performs unchecked serialization/deserialization of programs for when that's appropriate.
