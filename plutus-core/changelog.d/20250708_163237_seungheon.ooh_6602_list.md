### Added

- Added support for `Case`ing on builtin lists. When `Case`ing a builtin list, exactly one or two branches are allowed: with a single branch, Case assumes the list is non-empty and applies the head element and the tail to that branch; with two branches, the first branch is selected if the list is empty (and takes no arguments), and the second branch is chosen if the list is non-empty, receiving the head element and the tail as its arguments. Note, the single branch **WILL FAIL** the script evaluation if empty list is given.
