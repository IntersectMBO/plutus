### Changed

- The signature of the `writeBits` PLC builtin has been changed from
```
[bytestring, list integer, list boolean] -> bytestring
```

to

```
[bytestring, list integer, boolean] -> bytestring
```

Instead of a list of boolean values to write to bit positions specified in the
second argument it now takes a single boolean value which is used to update the
bits at all of the given positions.  If it's necessary to set some bits and
clear others then the function shouldbe called twice, once with `True` as the
third argument and once with `False`.
