### Added

- Added a new emitter mode `logWithCallTraceEmitter` which uses trace messages generated by `PlutusTx.Plugin:profile-all` flag of plutus-tx-plugin to create call trace of the functions that led to the evaluation failure. If script passes or script is not compiled with `profile-all` flag, `logWithCallTraceEmitter` will behave as regular `logEmitter`.
