### Changed

- The methoods in the `Flat` instances for `PlutusCore.Crypto.BLS12_381.G1.Element` and `PlutusCore.Crypto.BLS12_381.G2.Element` now cause failures: if a user wishes to use a literal constant in a serialised script then they should use the relevant `uncompress` function on a bytestring.  For convenience in experimentation and testing, literal constants are still allowed in textual Plutus Core programs, but any attempt to convert such a program to `flat` format will fail.

- The `zero` and `generator` constants (for use in `plutus-tx`) have been removed from `PlutusCore.Crypto.BLS12_381.G1.Element` and `PlutusCore.Crypto.BLS12_381.G2.Element` and replaced with bytestrings called `compressed_zero` and `compressed_generator`; the original elements can be recovered by applying the appropriate `uncompress` functions to these.
