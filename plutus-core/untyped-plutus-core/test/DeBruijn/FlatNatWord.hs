-- * Old implementation of Flat Index copy-pasted and renamed to OldIndex

{- |
The old implementation relied on this function which is safe
*only* for 64-bit systems. There were previously safety checks to fail compilation
on other systems, but we removed them  since we only test on 64-bit systems afterall.
