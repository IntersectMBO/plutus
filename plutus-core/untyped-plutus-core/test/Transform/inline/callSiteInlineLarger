{- Here f occurs more than once so it is not inlined unconditionally.
But it should NOT be inlined by the callsite inliner because \b c d -> 6 is larger than f 2


let f = \a b c d -> 6
   g = f
in f 2

In UPLC:

(\f -> (\g -> f 2) (f) ) (\a b c d -> 6)

[
  (lam f [(lam g [f (con integer 2)]) f])
  (lam
    a
    (lam
      b
      (lam c (lam d (con integer 6)))
    )
