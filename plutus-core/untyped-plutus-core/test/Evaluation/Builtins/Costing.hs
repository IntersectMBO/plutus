{- Note [Generating a CostRose]
We use an overly pedantic approach for generating 'CostRose's. The idea is simple: generate a list
of costs, chop it into chunks and turn each of those into its own 'CostRose' recursively, then
assemble them together to get the resulting 'CostRose'. We do it this way, because that makes it
trivial to ensure that the generator is not exponential as each generated 'CostRose' only has those
(and only those) elements in it that came from the generated list and the generator for lists isn't
exponential. It also makes it easy to control the distribution of the shapes of generated
'CostRose's. Do we want long forests? Do we want to cover all possible trees up to a certain depth?
All of that is easy to tweak, although the actual logic can get complicated pretty quickly. But at
least all this complicated logic is fairly local unlike with the usual approach when generation is
size-driven and minor tweaks in size handling at any step can result in major changes in the overall
generation strategy such as exponential growth of the generated objects.
