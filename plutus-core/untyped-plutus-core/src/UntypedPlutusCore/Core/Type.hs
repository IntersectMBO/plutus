{- Note [Term constructor ordering and numbers]
Ordering of constructors has a small but real effect on efficiency.
It's slightly more efficient to hit the earlier constructors, so it's better to put the more
common ones first.

The current ordering is based on their *empirically observed* frequency. We should check this
occasionally.

Additionally, the first 7 (or 3 on 32-bit systems) constructors will get *pointer tags*, which allows
more efficient access when casing on them. So we ideally want to keep the number of constructors
at 7 or fewer.

We've got 8 constructors, *but* the last one is Error, which is only going to be seen at most
once per program, so it's not too big a deal if it doesn't get a tag.

{-| The type of Untyped Plutus Core terms. Mirrors the type of Typed Plutus Core terms except

1. all types are removed
2. 'IWrap' and 'Unwrap' are removed
3. type abstractions are replaced with 'Delay'
4. type instantiations are replaced with 'Force'

The latter two are due to the fact that we don't have value restriction in Typed Plutus Core
and hence a computation can be stuck expecting only a single type argument for the computation
to become unstuck. Therefore we can't just silently remove type abstractions and instantions and
need to replace them with something else that also blocks evaluation (in order for the semantics
of an erased program to match with the semantics of the original typed one). 'Delay' and 'Force'
serve exactly this purpose.
