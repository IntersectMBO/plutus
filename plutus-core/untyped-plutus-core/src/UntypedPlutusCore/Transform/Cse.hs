1. Simplifications
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a simplified (i.e., not fully optimal) implementation of CSE. The two simplifications
we made are:

- No alpha equivalence check, i.e., `\x -> x` and `\y -> y` are considered different expressions.
- The builtin function arity information is approximate: rather than using the accurate arities,
  we simply use the maximum number of arguments applied to a builtin function in the program
  as the builtin function's arity. The arity information is used to determine whether a builtin
  application is possibly saturated.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. How does it work?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We use the following example to explain how the implementation works:

\x y -> (1+(2+x))
        +
        (case y [ (1+(2+x)) + (3+x)
                , (2+x) + (3+x)
                , 4+x
                ]
        )

The implementation makes several passes on the given term. The first pass collects builtin
arity information as described above.

In the second pass, we assign a unique ID to each `LamAbs`, `Delay`, and each `Case` branch.
Then, we annotate each subterm with a path, consisting of IDs encountered from the root
to that subterm (not including itself). The reason to do this is because `LamAbs`, `Delay`,
and `Case` branches represent places where computation stops, i.e., subexpressions are not
immediately evaluated, and may not be evaluated at all.

In the above example, the ID of `\x` is 0, the ID of `\y` is 1, and the IDs of the
three case branches are 2, 3, 4 (the actual numbers don't matter, as long as they are unique).
The path for the first `1+(2+x)` and the first `2+x` is "0.1"; the path for the second
`1+(2+x)` and the second `2+x` is "0.1.2"; the path for `4+x` is "0.1.4".

In the third pass, we calculate a count for each `(term, path)` pair, where `term` is a
non-workfree term, and `path` is its path. If the same term has two paths, and one is an
ancestor (i.e., prefix) of the other, we increment the count for the ancestor path in both
instances.

In the above example, there are three occurrences of `2+x`, whose paths are "0.1", "0.1.2"
and "0.1.3", respectively. The first path is an ancestor of the latter two. Therefore,
the count for `(2+x, "0.1")` is 3, while the count for `(2+x, "0.1.2")` and `(2+x, "0.1.3")`
is 0. The following all have a count of 1: `(3+x, "0.1.2")`, `(3+x, "0.1.3")` and
`(4+x, "0.1.4")`.

Now, each `(term, path)` pair whose count is greater than 1 is a CSE candidate.
In the above example, the CSE candidates are `(2+x, "0.1")` and `(1+(2+x), "0.1")`.
Note that `3+x` is not a CSE candidate, because it has two paths, and neither has a count
greater than 1. `2+` is also not a CSE candidate, because it is workfree.

The CSE candidates are then processed in descending order of their `termSize`s. For each CSE
candidate, we generate a fresh variable, create a LamAbs for it under its path, and substitute
it for all occurrences in the original term whose paths are descendents (or self) of
the candidate's path. The order is because a bigger expression may contain a small subexpression.

In the above example, we first process CSE candidate `(1+(2+x), "0.1")`. We create a fresh
variable `cse1` for it, perform substitution, and create a `LamAbs` under path "0.1" (i.e., around
the body of `y`). After processing this CSE candidate, the original term becomes

\x y -> (\cse1 -> cse1
                  +
                  (case y [ cse1 + (3+x)
                          , (2+x) + (3+x)
                          , 4+x
                          ]
        ) (1+(2+x))

The second CSE candidate is processed similarly, and the final result is

\x y -> (\cse2 -> (\cse1 -> cse1
                            +
                            (case y [ cse1 + (3+x)
                                    , cse2 + (3+x)
                                    , 4+x
                                    ]
                  ) (1+cse2)
        ) (2+x)

Here's another example:

force (force ifThenElse
         (lessThanEqualsInteger 0 0)
         (delay ((1+2) + (1+2)))
         (delay (1+2))
      )

In this case, the first two occurrences of `1+2` can be CSE'd, but the third occurrence
can not. This is ensured by checking the path when substituting `cse1` for `1+2`. The result is

force (force ifThenElse
         (lessThanEqualsInteger 0 0)
         (delay ((\cse1 -> cse1 + cse1) (1+2))
         (delay (1+2))
      )

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. When should CSE run?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CSE should run for multiple iterations, and should interleave with inlining. The following
example illustrates why:

\x ->
  f
    ((\y -> 1+(y+y)) (0+x))
    ((\z -> 2+(z+z)) (0+x))

There is no inlining opportunity in this term. After the first iteration of CSE, where
the common subepxression is `0+x`, we get:

\x ->
  (\cse1 ->
    f
      ((\y -> 1+(y+y)) cse1)
      ((\z -> 2+(z+z)) cse1)
  ) (0+x)

Now `y` and `z` can be inlined, after which we get

\x ->
  (\cse1 ->
    f
      (1+(cse1+cse1))
      (2+(cse1+cse1))
  ) (0+x)

Now there's a new common subexpression: `cse1+cse1`. So another iteration of CSE is
needed, yielding:

\x ->
  (\cse1 ->
    (\cse2 ->
      f
        (1+cse2)
        (2+cse2)
    ) (cse1+cse1)
  ) (0+x)

With this example in mind, one may be tempted to make CSE part of the simplifier, and simply
run it along with the rest of the simplifier. That is, however, a bad idea. CSE does the reverse
of inlining; inlining tends to expose more optimization opportunities, and conversely, CSE
tends to destroy optimization opportunities. Running CSE on a not-fully-optimized program
may cause many optimization opportunities to be permanently lost. Give it a try if you want
to see how bad it is!

Therefore, this is what we do: first run the simplifier iterations. Then, run the CSE iterations,
interleaving with the simplifier. For example, suppose max-simplifier-iterations-uplc=12, and
max-cse-iterations=4. We first run 12 iterations of the simplifier, then run 4 iterations
of CSE, with a simplifier pass after each iteration of CSE (i.e., the simplifier is run for a
total of 16 times).

Finally, since CSE can change the order or the number of occurrences of effects, it is only run
when conservative optimization is off.
