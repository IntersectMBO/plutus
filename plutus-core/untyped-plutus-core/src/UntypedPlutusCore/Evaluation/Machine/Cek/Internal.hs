{- Note [Compilation peculiarities]
READ THIS BEFORE TOUCHING ANYTHING IN THIS FILE

Don't use @StrictData@, it makes the machine slower by several percent.

Exporting the 'computeCek' function from this module causes the CEK machine to become slower by
up to 25%. I repeat: just adding 'computeCek' to the export list makes the evaluator substantially
slower. The reason for this is that with 'computeCek' exported the generated GHC Core is much worse:
it contains more lambdas, allocates more stuff etc. While perhaps surprising, this is not an
unusual behavior of the compiler as https://wiki.haskell.org/Performance/GHC explains:

> Indeed, generally speaking GHC will inline across modules just as much as it does within modules,
> with a single large exception. If GHC sees that a function 'f' is called just once, it inlines it
> regardless of how big 'f' is. But once 'f' is exported, GHC can never see that it's called exactly
> once, even if that later turns out to be the case. This inline-once optimisation is pretty
> important in practice.
>
> So: if you care about performance, do not export functions that are not used outside the module
> (i.e. use an explicit export list, and keep it as small as possible).

Now clearly 'computeCek' cannot be inlined in 'runCek' whether it's exported or not, since
'computeCek' is recursive. However:

1. GHC is _usually_ smart enough to perform the worker/wrapper transformation and inline the wrapper
   (however experiments have shown that sticking the internals of the CEK machine, budgeting modes
   and the API into the same file prevents GHC from performing the worker/wrapper transformation for
   some reason likely related to "we've been compiling this for too long, let's leave it at that"
2. GHC seems to be able to massage the definition of 'computeCek' into something more performant
   making use of knowing exactly how 'computeCek' is used, essentially tailoring the definition of
   'computeCek' for a particular invocation in 'runCek'

Hence we don't export 'computeCek' and instead define 'runCek' in this file and export it, even
though the rest of the user-facing API (which 'runCek' is a part of) is defined downstream.

Another problem is handling mutual recursion in the 'computeCek'/'returnCek'/'forceEvaluate'/etc
family. If we keep these functions at the top level, GHC won't be able to pull the constraints out of
the family (confirmed by inspecting Core: GHC thinks that since the superclass constraints
populating the dictionary representing the @Ix fun@ constraint are redundant, they can be replaced
with calls to 'error' in a recursive call, but that changes the dictionary and so it can no longer
be pulled out of recursion). But that entails passing a redundant argument around, which slows down
the machine a tiny little bit.

Hence we define a number of the functions as local functions making use of a
shared context from their parent function. This also allows GHC to inline almost
all of the machine into a single definition (with a bunch of recursive join
points in it).

In general, it's advised to run benchmarks (and look at Core output if the results are suspicious)
on any changes in this file.

to check that type and term arguments are interleaved correctly.  The
first copy of the arity is left unaltered and only used by
dischargeCekValue if we have to convert the frame back into a term
(see mkBuiltinApplication).  An alternative would be to look up the
full arity in mkBuiltinApplication, but that would require a lot of
things to be monadic (including the PrettyBy instance for CekValue,
which is a problem.)

{- Note [Implicit parameters in the machine]
The traditional way to pass context into a function is to use 'ReaderT'. However, 'ReaderT' has some
disadvantages.
- It requires threading through the context even where you don't need it (every monadic bind)
- It *can* often be optimized away, but this requires GHC to be somewhat clever and do a lot of
  case-of-case to lift all the arguments out.

Moreover, if your context is global (i.e. constant across the lifetime of the monad, i.e. you don't
need 'local'), then you're buying some extra power (the ability to pass in a different context somewhere
deep inside the computation) which you don't need.

There are three main alternatives:
- Explicit function parameters. Simple, doesn't get tied up in the Monad operations, *does* still
present the appearance of letting you do 'local'. But a bit cluttered.
- Implicit parameters. A bit esoteric, can be bundled up into a constraint synonym and just piped to
where they're needed, essentially the same as explicit parameters in terms of runtime.
- Constraints via 'reflection'. Quite esoteric, *does* get you global parameters (within their scope),
bit of a hassle threading around all the extra type parameters.

We're using implicit parameters for now, which seems to strike a good balance of speed and convenience.
I haven't tried 'reflection' in detail, but I believe the main thing it would do is to make the parameters
global - but we already have this for most of the hot functions by making them all local definitions, so
they don't actually take the context as an argument even at the source level.

{- Note [Being generic over 'term' in errors]
Our error for the CEK machine carries a term with it as a possible 'cause'. This is defined in
terms of an underlying type that is generic over this 'term' type.

The point is that in many different cases we can annotate an evaluation failure with a 'Term' that
caused it. Originally we were using 'CekValue' instead of 'Term', however that meant that we had to
ignore some important cases where we just can't produce a 'CekValue', for example if we encounter
a free variable, we can't turn it into a 'CekValue' and report the result as the cause of the
failure, which is bad. 'Term' is strictly more general than 'CekValue' and so we can always
1. report things like free variables
2. report a 'CekValue' turned into a 'Term' via 'dischargeCekValue'
We need the latter, because the constant application machinery, in the context of the CEK machine,
expects a list of 'CekValue's and so in the event of failure it has to report one of those
arguments, so we have no option but to call the constant application machinery with 'CekValue'
being the cause of a potential failure. But as mentioned, turning a 'CekValue' into a 'Term' is
no problem and we need that elsewhere anyway, so we don't need any extra machinery for calling the
constant application machinery over a list of 'CekValue's and turning the cause of a possible
failure into a 'Term', apart from the straightforward generalization of the error type.

{- Note [Throwing exceptions in ST]
This note represents MPJ's best understanding right now, might be wrong.

We use a moderately evil trick to throw exceptions in ST, but unlike the evil trick for catching them, it's hidden.

The evil is that the 'MonadThrow' instance for 'ST' uses 'unsafeIOToST . throwIO'! Sneaky! The author has marked it
"Trustworthy"", no less. However, I believe this to be safe for basically the same reasons as our trick to catch
exceptions is safe, see Note [Catching exceptions in ST]

{- Note [Catching exceptions in ST]
This note represents MPJ's best understanding right now, might be wrong.

We use a moderately evil trick to catch exceptions in ST. This uses the unsafe ST <-> IO conversion functions to go into IO,
catch the exception, and then go back into ST.

Why is this okay? Recall that IO ~= ST RealWorld, i.e. it is just ST with a special thread token. The unsafe conversion functions
just coerce from one to the other. So the thread token remains the same, it's just that we'll potentially leak it from ST, and we don't
get ordering guarantees with other IO actions.

But in our case this is okay, because:

1. We do not leak the original ST thread token, since we only pass it into IO and then immediately back again.
2. We don't have ordering guarantees with other IO actions, but we don't care because we don't do any side effects, we only catch a single kind of exception.
3. We *do* have ordering guarantees between the throws inside the ST action and the catch, since they are ultimately using the same thread token.

{- | Given a possibly partially applied/instantiated builtin, reconstruct the

    {- Note [Accumulating arguments].  The VBuiltin value contains lists of type and
    term arguments which grow as new arguments are encountered.  In the code below
    We just add new entries by appending to the end of the list: l -> l++[x].  This
    doesn't look terrbily good, but we don't expect the lists to ever contain more
    than three or four elements, so the cost is unlikely to be high.  We could
    accumulate lists in the normal way and reverse them when required, but this is
    error-prone and reversal adds an extra cost anyway.  We could also use something
    like Data.Sequence, but again we incur an extra cost because we have to convert
    to a normal list when passing the arguments to the constant application
    machinery.  If we really care we might want to convert the CAM to use sequences
    instead of lists.
