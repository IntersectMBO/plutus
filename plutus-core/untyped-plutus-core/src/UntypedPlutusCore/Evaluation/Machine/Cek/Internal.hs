{- Note [Compilation peculiarities]
READ THIS BEFORE TOUCHING ANYTHING IN THIS FILE

Don't use @StrictData@, it makes the machine slower by several percent.

Exporting the 'computeCek' function from this module causes the CEK machine to become slower by
up to 25%. I repeat: just adding 'computeCek' to the export list makes the evaluator substantially
slower. The reason for this is that with 'computeCek' exported the generated GHC Core is much worse:
it contains more lambdas, allocates more stuff etc. While perhaps surprising, this is not an
unusual behavior of the compiler as https://wiki.haskell.org/Performance/GHC explains:

> Indeed, generally speaking GHC will inline across modules just as much as it does within modules,
> with a single large exception. If GHC sees that a function 'f' is called just once, it inlines it
> regardless of how big 'f' is. But once 'f' is exported, GHC can never see that it's called exactly
> once, even if that later turns out to be the case. This inline-once optimisation is pretty
> important in practice.
>
> So: if you care about performance, do not export functions that are not used outside the module
> (i.e. use an explicit export list, and keep it as small as possible).

Now clearly 'computeCek' cannot be inlined in 'runCek' whether it's exported or not, since
'computeCek' is recursive. However:

1. GHC is _usually_ smart enough to perform the worker/wrapper transformation and inline the wrapper
   (however experiments have shown that sticking the internals of the CEK machine, budgeting modes
   and the API into the same file prevents GHC from performing the worker/wrapper transformation for
   some reason likely related to "we've been compiling this for too long, let's leave it at that"
2. GHC seems to be able to massage the definition of 'computeCek' into something more performant
   making use of knowing exactly how 'computeCek' is used, essentially tailoring the definition of
   'computeCek' for a particular invocation in 'runCek'

Hence we don't export 'computeCek' and instead define 'runCek' in this file and export it, even
though the rest of the user-facing API (which 'runCek' is a part of) is defined downstream.

Another problem is handling mutual recursion in the 'computeCek'/'returnCek'/'forceEvaluate'/etc
family. If we keep these functions at the top level, GHC won't be able to pull the constraints out of
the family (confirmed by inspecting Core: GHC thinks that since the superclass constraints
populating the dictionary representing the @Ix fun@ constraint are redundant, they can be replaced
with calls to 'error' in a recursive call, but that changes the dictionary and so it can no longer
be pulled out of recursion). But that entails passing a redundant argument around, which slows down
the machine a tiny little bit.

Hence we define a number of the functions as local functions making use of a
shared context from their parent function. This also allows GHC to inline almost
all of the machine into a single definition (with a bunch of recursive join
points in it).

In general, it's advised to run benchmarks (and look at Core output if the results are suspicious)
on any changes in this file.

Finally, it's important to put bang patterns on any Int arguments to ensure that GHC unboxes them:
this can make a surprisingly large difference.

{- Note [Cost slippage]
Tracking the budget usage for every step in the machine adds a lot of overhead. To reduce this,
we adopt a technique which allows some overshoot of the budget ("slippage"), but only a bounded
amount.

To do this we:
- Track all the machine steps of all kinds in an set of counters in a 'StepCounter'
- Actually "spend" the budget when we've done more than some fixed number of steps, or at the end.

This saves a *lot* of time, at the cost of potentially overshooting the budget by slippage*step_cost,
which is okay so long as we bound the slippage appropriately.

Note that we're only proposing to do this for machine steps, since it's plausible that we can track
them in an optimized way. Builtins are more complicated (and infrequent), so we can just budget them
properly when we hit them.

There are two options for how to bound the slippage:
1. As a fixed number of steps
2. As a proportion of the overall budget

Option 2 initially seems much better as a bound: if we run N scripts with an overall budget of B, then
the potential overrun from 1 is N*slippage, whereas the overrun from 2 is B*slippage. That is, 2
says we always overrun by a fraction of the total amount of time you were expecting, whereas 1 says
it depends how many scripts you run... so if I send you a lot of small scripts, I could cause a lot
of overrun.

However, it turns out (empirically) that we can pick a number for 1 that gives us most of the speedup, but such
that the maximum overrun is negligible (e.g. much smaller than the "startup cost"). So in the end
we opted for option 1, which also happens to be simpler to implement.
-}

{- Note [Structure of the step counter]
The step counter is kept in a 'MutablePrimArray', which is a fast way of storing a bunch of
mutable 'Word8's.
This suits our purposes, as we need one counter for every step type, and one for the total number.

We keep the counters for each step in the first indices, so we can index them simply by using
the 'Enum' instance of 'StepKind', and the total counter in the last index.

{- Note [DList-based emitting]
Instead of emitting log lines one by one, we have a 'DList' of them in the type of emitters
(see 'CekEmitter'). That 'DList' comes from 'Emitter' and allows the latter to be an efficient
monad for logging. We leak this implementation detail in the type of emitters, because it's the
most efficient way of doing emitting, see
https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/pull/4421#issuecomment-1059186586

newtype EmitterMode uni fun = EmitterMode
    { unEmitterMode :: forall s. ST s ExBudget -> ST s (CekEmitterInfo uni fun s)
    }

{- Note [Implicit parameters in the machine]
The traditional way to pass context into a function is to use 'ReaderT'. However, 'ReaderT' has some
disadvantages.
- It requires threading through the context even where you don't need it (every monadic bind)
- It *can* often be optimized away, but this requires GHC to be somewhat clever and do a lot of
  case-of-case to lift all the arguments out.

Moreover, if your context is global (i.e. constant across the lifetime of the monad, i.e. you don't
need 'local'), then you're buying some extra power (the ability to pass in a different context somewhere
deep inside the computation) which you don't need.

There are three main alternatives:
- Explicit function parameters. Simple, doesn't get tied up in the Monad operations, *does* still
present the appearance of letting you do 'local'. But a bit cluttered.
- Implicit parameters. A bit esoteric, can be bundled up into a constraint synonym and just piped to
where they're needed, essentially the same as explicit parameters in terms of runtime.
- Constraints via 'reflection'. Quite esoteric, *does* get you global parameters (within their scope),
bit of a hassle threading around all the extra type parameters.

We're using implicit parameters for now, which seems to strike a good balance of speed and convenience.
I haven't tried 'reflection' in detail, but I believe the main thing it would do is to make the parameters
global - but we already have this for most of the hot functions by making them all local definitions, so
they don't actually take the context as an argument even at the source level.

{- Note [Throwing exceptions in ST]
This note represents MPJ's best understanding right now, might be wrong.

We use a moderately evil trick to throw exceptions in ST, but unlike the evil trick for catching them, it's hidden.

The evil is that the 'MonadThrow' instance for 'ST' uses 'unsafeIOToST . throwIO'! Sneaky! The author has marked it
"Trustworthy", no less. However, I believe this to be safe for basically the same reasons as our trick to catch
exceptions is safe, see Note [Catching exceptions in ST]
-}

{- Note [Catching exceptions in ST]
This note represents MPJ's best understanding right now, might be wrong.

We use a moderately evil trick to catch exceptions in ST. This uses the unsafe ST <-> IO conversion functions to go into IO,
catch the exception, and then go back into ST.

Why is this okay? Recall that IO ~= ST RealWorld, i.e. it is just ST with a special thread token. The unsafe conversion functions
just coerce from one to the other. So the thread token remains the same, it's just that we'll potentially leak it from ST, and we don't
get ordering guarantees with other IO actions.

But in our case this is okay, because:

1. We do not leak the original ST thread token, since we only pass it into IO and then immediately back again.
2. We don't have ordering guarantees with other IO actions, but we don't care because we don't do any side effects, we only catch a single kind of exception.
3. We *do* have ordering guarantees between the throws inside the ST action and the catch, since they are ultimately using the same thread token.

{- Note [Accumulators for terms]
At a couple of points in the CEK machine (notably building the arguments to a constructor value)
we need to compute a list of terms into values.

Our usual strategy is to make a frame which has an (implicit) "hole" for the value we are computing,
and which stores the other sub-parts of the term as terms or values depending on whether we've computed
them yet or not (see e.g. how applications work).

We want to do the same sort of strategy here, but it's a bit more complicated. We need a hole
"in the middle" of the list, with computed values on one side and yet-to-be-computed terms on the other.
We also very much want to avoid allocating as much as possible.

The basic structure that we end up with has three parts:
1. Use the list of sub-terms from the original term as our "todo" queue, a list is a good structure for this.
2. Use an accumulator type with fast snoc to accumulate the values as we compute them.
3. Convert the accumulator quickly into a final type that is fast to process/lookup in later.

(this process was at one point made explicit with an interface, but in the end we just inlined it all away)

We tried at least three variants of this:
1. List/MutableVector/Vector
2. List/Seq/Seq
3. List/DList/List

Suprisingly, option 3 was just as performant as the others, so we opted to go with it for simplicity.
But there may well be a faster version.
