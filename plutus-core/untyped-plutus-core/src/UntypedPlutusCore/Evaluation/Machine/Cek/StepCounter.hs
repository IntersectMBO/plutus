{- Note [Step counter data structure]
The step counter data structure has had several iterations.

Previously we used a "word array", which was a single 'Word64' into which we
packed 8 'Word8's. This worked pretty well: it was pure, and everything reduced
to a bunch of primitive integer operations.

However, it has a key limitation which is that it can only hold 8 counters.
The obvious attempt to expand it to use a 'Word128' performed badly.

The 'PrimArray' approach on the other hand was fairly competitive with the
original 'WordArray', and scales fine to more than 8 counters, so we switched
to using that instead.
