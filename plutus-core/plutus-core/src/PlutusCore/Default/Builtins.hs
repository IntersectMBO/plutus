{- Note [How to add a built-in function: simple cases]
This Notes explains how to add a built-in function and how to read definitions of existing built-in
functions. It does not attempt to explain why things the way they are, that is explained in comments
in relevant files (will have a proper overview doc on that, but for now you can check out this
comment: https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/issues/4306#issuecomment-1003308938).

In order to add a new built-in function one needs to add a constructor to 'DefaultFun' and handle
it within the @ToBuiltinMeaning uni DefaultFun@ instance like this:

    toBuiltinMeaning <Name> =
        makeBuiltinMeaning
            <denotation>
            <costingFunction>

'makeBuiltinMeaning' creates a Plutus builtin out of its denotation (i.e. Haskell implementation)
and a costing function for it. Once a builtin is added, its Plutus type is kind-checked and printed
to a golden file automatically (consult @git status@).

Below we will enumerate what kind of denotations are accepted by 'makeBuiltinMeaning' without
touching any costing stuff.

1. The simplest example of an accepted denotation is a monomorphic function that takes values of
built-in types and returns a value of a built-in type as well. For example

    encodeUtf8 :: Text -> BS.ByteString

You can feed 'encodeUtf8' directly to 'makeBuiltinMeaning' without specifying any types:

    toBuiltinMeaning EncodeUtf8 =
        makeBuiltinMeaning
            encodeUtf8
            <costingFunction>

This will add the builtin, the only two things that remain are implementing costing for this
builtin (out of the scope of this Note) and handling it within the @Flat DefaultFun@ instance
(see Note [Stable encoding of PLC]).

2. If the type of the denotation has any constrained type variables in it, all of them need to be
instantiated. For example feeding @(+)@ directly to 'makeBuiltinMeaning' will give you an error
message asking to instantiate constrained type variables, which you can do via an explicit type
annotation or type application or using any other way of specifying types.

Here's how it looks with a type application instantiating the type variable of @(+)@:

    toBuiltinMeaning AddInteger =
        makeBuiltinMeaning
            ((+) @Integer)
            <costingFunction>

Or we can specify the whole type of the denotation by type-applying 'makeBuiltinMeaning':

    toBuiltinMeaning AddInteger =
        makeBuiltinMeaning
            @(Integer -> Integer -> Integer)
            (+)
            <costingFunction>

Or we can simply annotate @(+)@ with its monomorphized type:
    toBuiltinMeaning AddInteger =
        makeBuiltinMeaning
            ((+) :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer)
            <costingFunction>

All of these are equivalent.

3. Unconstrained type variables are fine, you don't need to instantiate them (but you may want to if
you want some builtin to be less general than what Haskell infers for its denotation). For example

    toBuiltinMeaning IfThenElse =
        makeBuiltinMeaning
            (\b x y -> if b then x else y)
            <costingFunction>

works alright. The inferred Haskell type of the denotation is

    forall a. Bool -> a -> a -> a

whose counterpart in Plutus is

    all a. bool -> a -> a -> a

and unsurprisingly it's the exact Plutus type of the added builtin.

It may seem like getting the latter from the former is entirely trivial, however
'makeBuiltinMeaning' jumps through quite a few hoops to achieve that and below we'll consider those
of them that are important to know to be able to use 'makeBuiltinMeaning' in cases that are more
complicated than a simple monomorphic or polymorphic function. But for now let's talk about a few
more simple cases.

4. Certain types are not built-in, but can be represented via built-in ones. For example, we don't
have 'Int' as a built-in, but we have 'Integer' and we can represent the former in terms of the
latter. The conversions between the two types are handled by 'makeBuiltinMeaning', so that the user
doesn't need to write them themselves and can just write

    toBuiltinMeaning LengthOfByteString =
        makeBuiltinMeaning
            BS.length
            <costingFunction>

directly (where @BS.length :: BS.ByteString -> Int@).

Note however that while it's always safe to convert an 'Int' to an 'Integer', doing the opposite is
not safe in general, because an 'Integer' may not fit into the range of 'Int'. For this reason

    YOU MUST NEVER USE 'fromIntegral' AND SIMILAR FUNCTIONS THAT CAN SILENTLY UNDER- OR OVERFLOW
    WHEN DEFINING A BUILT-IN FUNCTION

For example defining a builtin that takes an 'Integer' and converts it to an 'Int' using
'fromIntegral' is not allowed under any circumstances and can be a huge vulnerability.

It's completely fine to define a builtin that takes an 'Int' directly, though. How so? That's due
to the fact that the builtin application machinery checks that an 'Integer' is in the bounds of
'Int' before doing the conversion. If the bounds check succeeds, then the 'Integer' gets converted
to the corresponding 'Int', and if it doesn't, then the builtin application fails.

For the list of types that can be converted to/from built-in ones look into the file with the
default universe. If you need to add a new such type, just copy-paste what's done for an existing
one and adjust.

Speaking of builtin application failing:

5. A built-in function can fail. Whenever a builtin fails, evaluation of the whole program fails.
There's a number of ways a builtin can fail:

- as we've just seen a type conversion can fail due to an unsuccessful bounds check
- if the builtin expects, say, a 'Text' argument, but gets fed an 'Integer' argument
- if the builtin expects any constant, but gets fed a non-constant
- if its denotation runs in the 'EvaluationResult' and an 'EvaluationFailure' gets returned

Most of these are not a concern to the user defining a built-in function (conversions are handled
within the builtin application machinery, type mismatches are on the type checker and the person
writing the program etc), however explicitly returning 'EvaluationFailure' from a builtin is
something that happens commonly.

One simple example is a monomorphic function matching on a certain constructor and failing in all
other cases:

    toBuiltinMeaning UnIData =
        makeBuiltinMeaning
            (\case
                I i -> EvaluationSuccess i
                _   -> EvaluationFailure)
            <costingFunction>

The inferred type of the denotation is

    Data -> EvaluationResult Integer

and the Plutus type of the builtin is

    data -> integer

because the error effect is implicit in Plutus.

Returning @EvaluationResult a@ for a type variable @a@ is also fine, i.e. it doesn't matter whether
the denotation is monomorphic or polymorphic w.r.t. failing.

But note that

    'EvaluationResult' MUST BE EXPLICITLY USED FOR ANY FAILING BUILTIN AND THROWING AN EXCEPTION
    VIA 'error' OR 'throw' OR ELSE IS NOT ALLOWED AND CAN BE A HUGE VULNERABILITY. MAKE SURE THAT
    NONE OF THE FUNCTIONS THAT YOU USE TO DEFINE A BUILTIN THROW EXCEPTIONS

An argument of a builtin can't have 'EvaluationResult' in its type -- only the result.

6. A builtin can emit log messages. For that it needs to run in the 'Emitter' monad. The ergonomics
are the same as with 'EvaluationResult': 'Emitter' can't appear in the type of an argument and
polymorphism is fine. For example:

    toBuiltinMeaning Trace =
        makeBuiltinMeaning
            (\text a -> a <$ emitM text)
            <costingFunction>

The inferred type of the denotation is

    forall a. Text -> a -> Emitter a

and the Plutus type of the builtin is

    all a. text -> a -> a

because just like with the error effect, whether a function logs anything or not is not reflected
in its type.

'makeBuiltinMeaning' allows one to nest 'EvaluationResult' inside of 'Emitter' and vice versa,
but as always nesting monads inside of each other without using monad transformers doesn't have good
ergonomics, since computations of such a type can't be chained with a simple @(>>=)@.

This concludes the list of simple cases. Before we jump to the hard ones, we need to talk about how
polymorphism gets elaborated, so read Note [Elaboration of polymorphism] next.
-}

{- Note [Elaboration of polymorphism]
In Note [How to add a built-in function: simple cases] we defined the following builtin:

    toBuiltinMeaning IfThenElse =
        makeBuiltinMeaning
            (\b x y -> if b then x else y)
            <costingFunction>

whose inferred Haskell type is

    forall a. Bool -> a -> a -> a

The way 'makeBuiltinMeaning' handles such a type is by traversing it and instantiating every type
variable. What a type variable gets instantiated to depends on where it appears. When the entire
type of an argument is a single type variable, it gets instantiated to @Opaque term VarN@ where
@VarN@ is pseudocode for "a Haskell type representing a Plutus type variable with 'Unique' N"
(for the purpose of this explanation it doesn't matter what @VarN@ actually is).
See Note [Implementation of polymorphic built-in functions] for what 'Opaque' is.

So the type from the above elaborates to

    Bool -> Opaque term Var0 -> Opaque term Var0 -> Opaque term Var0

We could've specified this type explicitly (leaving out the @Var0@ thing for the elaboration
machinery to figure out):

    toBuiltinMeaning IfThenElse =
        makeBuiltinMeaning
            @(Bool -> Opaque term _ -> Opaque term _ -> Opaque term _)
            (\b x y -> if b then x else y)
            <costingFunction>

and this would be equivalent to the original definition. We didn't do that, because why bother if
the correct thing gets inferred anyway.

Another thing we could do is define an auxiliary function with a type signature and explicit
'Opaque' while still having explicit polymorphism:

    ifThenElse :: Bool -> Opaque term a -> Opaque term a -> Opaque term a
    ifThenElse b x y = if b then x else y

    toBuiltinMeaning IfThenElse =
        makeBuiltinMeaning
            ifThenElse
            <costingFunction>

This achieves the same, but note how @a@ is now an argument to 'Opaque' rather than the entire type
of an argument. In order for this definition to elaborate to the same type as before @a@ needs to be
instantiated to just @Var0@, as opposed to @Opaque term Var0@, because the 'Opaque' part is
already there, so this is what the elaboration machinery does.

So regardless of which method of defining 'IfThenElse' we choose, the type of its denotation gets
elaborated to the same

    Bool -> Opaque term Var0 -> Opaque term Var0 -> Opaque term Var0

which then gets digested, so that we can compute what Plutus type it corresponds to. The procedure
is simple: collect all distinct type variables, @all@-bind them and replace the usages with the
bound variables. This turns the type above into

    all a. bool -> a -> a -> a

which is the Plutus type of the 'IfThenElse' builtin.

It's of course allowed to have multiple type variables, e.g. in the following snippet:

    toBuiltinMeaning Const =
        makeBuiltinMeaning
            Prelude.const
            <costingFunction>

the Haskell type of 'const' gets inferred as

    forall a b. a -> b -> a

and the elaboration machinery turns that into

    Opaque term Var0 -> Opaque term Var1 -> Opaque term Var0

The elaboration machinery respects the explicitly specified parts of the type and does not attempt
to argue with them. For example if the user insisted that the instantiated type of 'const' had
@Var0@ and @Var1@ swapped:

    Opaque term Var1 -> Opaque term Var0 -> Opaque term Var1

the elaboration machinery wouldn't make a fuss about that.

As a final simple example, consider

    toBuiltinMeaning Trace =
        makeBuiltinMeaning
            (\text a -> a <$ emitM text)
            <costingFunction>

from [How to add a built-in function: simple cases]. The inferred type of the denotation is

    forall a. Text -> a -> Emitter a

which elaborates to

    Text -> Opaque term Var0 -> Emitter (Opaque term Var0)

Elaboration machinery is able to look under 'Emitter' and 'EvaluationResult' even if there's a type
variable inside that does not appear anywhere else in the type signature, for example the inferred
type of the denotation in

    toBuiltinMeaning ErrorPrime =
        makeBuiltinMeaning
            EvaluationFailure
            <costingFunction>

is

    forall a. EvaluationResult a

which gets elaborated to

    EvaluationResult (Opaque term Var0)

from which the final Plutus type of the builtin is computed:

    all a. a
