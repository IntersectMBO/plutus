-- | This module provides a 'DefaultMachineParameters' with builtins doing immediate unlifting (see
-- the docs of 'UnliftingMode' for more info). We keep it separate, because we want to be able to
-- inspect the Core that it compiles to and it's already multiple thousands lines of code, so
-- keeping it together with other stuff would make it even harder to read that Core.

-- No need to mark this as 'INLINE', since a 'CostModelParams' comes in at runtime and so we can't
-- get the builtins to optimize any further. We don't need to optimize the 'MonadError' part, since
-- it's only computed when the parameters change, not multiple times (not even once) per contract
-- like builtins.
