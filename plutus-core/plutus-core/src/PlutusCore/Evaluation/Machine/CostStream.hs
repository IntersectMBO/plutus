{- Note [Single-element streams]
Both 'CostStream' and 'ExBudgetStream' are semantically equivalent to 'NonEmpty' (modulo strictness)
except instead of making the first element of each of these stream types a special one, we make
special the last one. The reason for this is that we want to maximally optimize the case of a
single-element stream, because it's the most common one and with a 'NonEmpty'-style data type we'd
have to pattern match twice in order to extract the value from the head of the stream and make sure
it's a single one, while with our approach it's only one pattern match. Plus we don't need to touch
any recursive parts at all when we're operating with single-element streams. It comes at a cost
however: recursive functions over streams often need to have the single-element case hardcoded even
when the general recursion would suffice, because GHC can't inline recursive functions and we rely
on inlining heavily. So we often manually unwrap one step of recursion just to make the wrapper
inlineable allowing for optimized handling of single-element streams.

-- The semantics of a stream are those of the sum of its elements. I.e. a stream that is a reordered
-- version of another stream is considered equal to that stream.

-- All costs are assumed not to be negative and functions handling 'CostStream's may rely on this
-- assumption. Negative costs (a.k.a. allowing the user to forge execution units at runtime)

{- Note [Global local functions]
Normally when defining a helper function one would put it into a @where@ or a @let@ block.
However if the enclosing function gets inlined, then the definition of the helper one gets inlined
too, which when happens in multiple places can create serious GHC Core bloat, making it really hard
to analyze the generated code. Hence in some cases we optimize for lower amounts of produced GHC
Core by turning some helper functions into global ones.

This doesn't work as well when the helper function captures a variable bound by the enclosing one,
so we leave such helper functions local. We could probably create a global helper and a local
function within it instead, but so far it doesn't appear as those capturing helpers actually get
duplicated in the generated Core.
