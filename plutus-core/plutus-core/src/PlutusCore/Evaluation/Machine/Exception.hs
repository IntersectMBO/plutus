{- Note [Ignoring context in UserEvaluationError]
The UserEvaluationError error has a term argument, but
extractEvaluationResult just discards this and returns
EvaluationFailure.  This means that, for example, if we use the `plc`
command to execute a program containing a division by zero, plc exits
silently without reporting that anything has gone wrong (but returning
a non-zero exit code to the shell via `exitFailure`).  This is because
UserEvaluationError is used in cases when a PLC program itself goes
wrong (for example, a failure due to `(error)`, a failure during
builtin evaluation, or exceeding the gas limit).  This is used to
signal unsuccessful in validation and so is not regarded as a real
error; in contrast, machine errors, typechecking failures,
and so on are genuine errors and we report their context if available.
