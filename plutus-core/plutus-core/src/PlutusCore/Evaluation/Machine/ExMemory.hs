{- Note [Memory Usage for Plutus]

The base unit is 'ExMemory', which corresponds to machine words. For primitives,
we use static values for the size, see the corresponding instances. For
composite data types, the Generic instance is used, + 1 for the constructor tag.
For ADTs, the currently selected branch is counted, not the maximum value.
Memory usage of the annotation is not counted, because this should be
abstractly specifiable. It's an implementation detail.

{- Note [Integer types for costing]
We care about the speed of our integer operations for costing, this has a significant effect on speed.
But we also need to care about overflow: the cost counters overflowing is a potential attack!

We have a few choices here for what to do with an overflow:
- Don't (this is what 'Integer' does, it's unbounded)
- Wrap (this is what 'Int'/'Int64' and friends do)
- Throw an overflow error (this is what 'Data.SafeInt' does)
- Saturate (i.e. return max/min bound, this is what 'Data.SatInt does)

In our case
- Not overflowing would be nice, but 'Integer' is significantly slower than the other types.
- Wrapping is quite dangerous, as it could lead to us getting attacked by someone wrapping
their cost around to something that looks below the budget.
- Throwing would be okay, but we'd have to worry about exception catching.
- Saturating is actually quite nice: we care about whether `a op b < budget`. So long as `budget < maxBound`,
  then `a op b < budget` will have the same truth value *regardless* of whether the operation overflows and saturates,
  since saturating implies `a op b >= maxBound > budget`. Plus, it means we don't need to deal with
  exceptions.

So we use 'Data.SatInt', a variant of 'Data.SafeInt' that does saturating arithmetic.

'SatInt' is quite fast, but not quite as fast as using 'Int64' directly (I don't know
why that would be, apart from maybe just the overflow checks), but the wrapping behaviour
of 'Int64' is unacceptable.

One other wrinkle is that 'SatInt' is backed by an 'Int' (i.e. a machine integer
with platform-dependent size), rather than an 'Int64' since the primops that we
need are only available for 'Int' until GHC 9.2 or so. So on 32bit platforms, we
would have much less headroom.

However, we don't build on 32bit platforms anyway, so we can ignore that.

We don't do

    deriving via Sum A Semigroup A
    deriving via Sum A Monoid A

because the 'Semigroup' and 'Monoid' instances for 'Sum' don't have @INLINE@ pragmas resulting in
'<>' and 'mempty' appearing in the generated Core.

So instead we implement @Semigroup A@ and @Monoid A@ instances manually for a 'Sum'-like @A@.
