{- Note [ExMemoryUsage instances for non-constants]
In order to calculate the cost of a built-in function we need to feed the 'ExMemory' of each
argument to the costing function associated with the builtin. For a polymorphic builtin this means
that we need to be able to compute the 'ExMemory' of the AST provided as an argument to the builtin.
How do we do that? Our strategy is:

1. if the AST is a wrapped constant, then calculate the 'ExMemory' of the constant
2. if the AST is something else, return 1

This is pretty reasonable: a polymorphic builtin *is* allowed to check if the AST that it got as an
argument is a constant or not, and if it happens to be a constant, the builtin *is* allowed to use
it whatever way it wishes (see Note [Builtins and Plutus type checking] for details). Hence a
builtin may in fact do something ad hoc for constants and we need to account for this possibility in
the costing machinery.

But if the given AST is not a constant, the builtin can't do anything else with it, hence we simply
return 1, meaning "the costing function can't use this 'ExMemory' in any non-vacuous way".

See 'HasMeaningIn' for a full list of constraints determining what a builtin can do with values.

However for all types of values, except the one used by the production evaluator, we implement
'ExMemoryUsage' as a call to 'error'. Not because other evaluators don't compute costs during
evaluation -- the CK machine for example does in fact compute them (because we share the same
builtins machinery between all the evaluators and we want it to be efficient on the production path,
hence it's easier to optimize it for all evaluators than just for the single production evaluator).
And not because the resulting 'ExBudget' is not forced by an evaluator that doesn't care about
costing -- it still gets forced (for the same reason).

The actual reason why we call 'error' is because at the moment no builtin is supposed to have a
costing function that actually computes the 'ExMemory' of the given AST. Currently, if the builtin
takes an 'Opaque', it's not supposed to actually look inside of it (unlike with 'SomeConstant') and
hence the costing function is supposed to ignore that argument. It is possible that we'll eventually
decide to add such a builtin, so the current approach of throwing an 'error' is a precaution
ensuring that we won't add any weirdness by accident.

We don't call 'error' on the production path, because we don't want this risk in there. A failing
test is fine, a failing reasonable transaction is not and we don't want to risk it, even if it seems
very unlikely that such a failure could slip in.

The way we ignore arguments in costing functions is by computing the 'ExMemory' of each of those
arguments lazily. I.e. a call to 'memoryUsage' can only be forced within a costing function and
never outside of one. We have to do this regardless of all the reasoning above: if we compute
the 'ExMemory' of, say, a list strictly, then a builtin prepending an element to a list will
have the complexity of O(length_of_the_list) (because computing the 'ExMemory' of a list requires
traversing the list), while we of course want it to be O(1).

{- Another naive traversal for size.  This accounts for the number of nodes in
   a Data object, and also the sizes of the contents of the nodes.  This is not
   ideal, but it seems to be the best we can do.  At present this only comes
   into play for 'equalsData', which is implemented using the derived
   implementation of '==' (fortunately the costing functions are lazy, so this
   won't be called for things like 'unBData' which have constant costing
   functions because they only have to look at the top node).  The problem is
   that when we call 'equalsData' the comparison will take place entirely in
   Haskell, so the costing functions for the contents of 'I' and 'B' nodes
   won't be called.  Thus if we just counted the number of nodes the sizes of
   'I 2' and 'B <huge bytestring>' would be the same but they'd take different
   amounts of time to compare.  It's not clear how to trade off the costs of
   processing a node and processing the contents of nodes: the implementation
   below compromises by charging four units per node, but we may wish to revise
   this after experimentation.

{- Note [Costing constant-size types]
The memory usage of each of the BLS12-381 types is constant, so we may be able
to optimise things a little by ensuring that we don't re-compute the size of
(say) a G1 element every time one is used. GHC will probably do this anyway, but
we make sure by defining a top level function for each of the size measures and
getting the memoryUsage instances to call those.
