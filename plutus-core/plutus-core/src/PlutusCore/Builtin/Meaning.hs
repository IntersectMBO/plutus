{- Note [Automatic derivation of type schemes]
We use two type classes for automatic derivation of type/runtime schemes and runtime denotations:
'KnownPolytype' and 'KnownMonotype'.
The terminology is due to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system#The_Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system

Check out the source of "PlutusCore.Builtin.Runtime" for an explanation of what a runtime
denotation is.

'KnownPolytype' and 'KnownMonotype' are responsible for deriving polymorphic and monomorphic types,
respectively.

'KnownPolytype' turns every bound variable into a 'TypeSchemeAll'/'RuntimeSchemeAll'. We extract
variables from the type of the Haskell denotation using the 'ToBinds' associated type
family. Variables are collected in the order that they appear in (i.e. just like in Haskell). For
example, processing a type like

      :: ( a ~ Opaque val (TyVarRep ('TyNameRep "a" 0))
         , b ~ Opaque val (TyVarRep ('TyNameRep "b" 1))
         )
      => b -> a -> b

with 'ToBinds' results in the following list of bindings:

    '[ 'Some ('TyNameRep "b" 1), 'Some ('TyNameRep "a" 0) ]

'KnownMonotype' turns every argument that the Haskell denotation of a builtin receives into a
'TypeSchemeArrow'/'RuntimeSchemeArrow'. We extract the arguments from the type of the Haskell
denotation using the 'GetArgs' type family.

Higher-kinded type variables are fully supported.

At this point in the pipeline the type of the denotation of a builtin is assumed to be fully
elaborated (i.e. monomorphic).

-- evaluation-irrelevant stuff in the constructors of 'TypeScheme', which makes it much harder to
-- read the Core. Technically speaking, we could convert a 'TypeScheme' to a 'RuntimeScheme'
-- statically if we changed the definition of 'TypeScheme' and made it a singleton, but then the
-- conversion function would have to become a class anyway and we'd just replicate what we have
-- here, except in a much more complicated way. It's also more efficient to generate
-- 'RuntimeScheme's directly, but that shouldn't really matter, given that they are only computed
-- once and get cached afterwards.
--
-- Similarly, we could've computed the runtime denotations ('toImmediateF' and 'toDeferredF')
-- from a 'TypeScheme' but not statically again, and that would break inlining and basically all
-- the optimization.
