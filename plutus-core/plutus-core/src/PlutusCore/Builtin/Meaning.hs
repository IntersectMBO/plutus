-- | The meaning of a built-in function consists of its type represented as a 'TypeScheme',
-- its Haskell denotation and a costing function (both in uninstantiated form).
--
-- The 'TypeScheme' of a built-in function is used for
--
-- 1. computing the PLC type of the function to be used during type checking
-- 2. checking equality of the expected type of an argument of a builtin and the actual one
--    during evaluation, so that we can avoid unsafe-coercing
--
-- A costing function for a built-in function is computed from a cost model for all built-in
-- functions from a certain set, hence the @cost@ parameter.

-- I tried making it @(forall val. HasConstantIn uni val => TypeScheme val args res)@ instead of
-- @TypeScheme val args res@, but 'makeBuiltinMeaning' has to talk about
-- @KnownPolytype binds val args res a@ (note the @val@), because instances of 'KnownMonotype'
-- are constrained with @KnownType val arg@ and @KnownType val res@, and so the earliest we can
-- generalize from @val@ to @UniOf val@ is in 'toBuiltinMeaning'.
-- Besides, for 'BuiltinRuntime' we want to have a concrete 'TypeScheme' anyway for performance
-- reasons (there isn't much point in caching a value of a type with a constraint as it becomes a
-- function at runtime anyway, due to constraints being compiled as dictionaries).

{- Note [Automatic derivation of type schemes]
We use two type classes for automatic derivation of type schemes: 'KnownMonotype' and
'KnownPolytype'. The terminology is due to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system#The_Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system

'KnownMonotype' and 'KnownPolytype' are responsible for deriving monomorphic and polymorphic types,
respectively. 'KnownMonotype' turns every argument that the Haskell denotation of a builtin
receives into a 'TypeSchemeArrow'. We extract the arguments from the type of the Haskell denotation
using the 'GetArgs' type family. 'KnownPolytype' turns every bound variable into a 'TypeSchemeAll'.
We extract variables from the type of the Haskell denotation using the 'ToBinds' type family
(in particular, see the @ToBinds (TypeScheme val args res)@ type instances). Variables are
collected in the order that they appear in (i.e. just like in Haskell). For example, processing
a type signature like

    const
        :: ( a ~ Opaque val (TyVarRep ('TyNameRep "a" 0))
           , b ~ Opaque val (TyVarRep ('TyNameRep "b" 1))
           )
        => b -> a -> b

with 'ToBinds' results in the following list of bindings:

    '[ 'Some ('TyNameRep "b" 1), 'Some ('TyNameRep "a" 0) ]

Higher-kinded type variables are fully supported.

The implementations of the 'KnownMonotype' and 'KnownPolytype' classes are structured in an
inference-friendly manner:

1. we compute @args@ using a type family ('GetArgs') in order to dispatch on the list of
   arguments of a built-in function in a way that doesn't force us to introduce overlapping
   instances
2. the @a -> res@ dependency allows us not to compute @res@ using a type family like with @args@
3. the @args res -> a@ dependency allows us not to mention @a@ in the type of 'knownMonotype'

Polymorphic built-in functions are handled via automatic specialization of all Haskell type
variables as types representing PLC type variables, as long as each Haskell variable appears as a
left argument to @(->)@ and is not buried somewhere inside (i.e. automatic derivation can handle
neither @f a@, @ListRep a@, nor @f Int@. Nor is @a -> b@ allowed to the left of an @(->)@.
Where all lower-case names are Haskell type variables). We'll call functions having such types
"simply-polymorphic". See the docs of 'EnumerateFromTo' for details.

The end result is that the user only has to specify the type of the denotation of a built-in
function and the 'TypeScheme' of the built-in function will be derived automatically. And in the
monomorphic and simply-polymorphic cases no types need to be specified at all.
