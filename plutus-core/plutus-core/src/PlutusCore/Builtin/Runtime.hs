-- | A 'BuiltinRuntime' represents a possibly partial builtin application, including an empty
-- builtin application (i.e. just the builtin with no arguments).
--
-- Applying or type-instantiating a builtin peels off the corresponding constructor from its
-- 'BuiltinRuntime'.
--
-- 'BuiltinCostedResult' contains the cost (an 'ExBudgetStream') and the result (a
-- @BuiltinResult (HeadSpine val)@) of the builtin application. The cost is stored strictly, since
-- the evaluator is going to look at it and the result is stored lazily, since it's not supposed to
-- be forced before accounting for the cost of the application. If the cost exceeds the available
-- budget, the evaluator discards the result of the builtin application without ever forcing it and
-- terminates with evaluation failure. Allowing the user to compute something that they don't have
-- the budget for would be a major bug.
--
-- Evaluators that ignore the entire concept of costing (e.g. the CK machine) may of course force
-- the result of the builtin application unconditionally.

{- Note [DO NOT newtype-wrap functions]
If you put a functional type into a @newtype@ rather than strict @data@, the GHC optimizer will be
able to see through it and will feel compelled to rearrange lambdas and case-expressions as it sees
fit, which it often does incorrectly due to @-fpedantic-bottoms@ not being enabled by default.

We've had a very confusing case of GHC turning

    case y of
        y' -> \x -> z

into

    \x -> case y of
        y' -> z

and ruining carefully set up optimizations
(see https://github.com/IntersectMBO/plutus/pull/4914#issuecomment-1396306606).

Even strict @data@ is slower than @newtype@, but in practice GHC is going to
worker-wrapper-transform such code making it as efficient as the @newtype@ version.

So you should never newtype-wrap functions, use strict @data@ instead.
