-- | A 'BuiltinRuntime' represents a possibly partial builtin application.
-- We get an initial 'BuiltinRuntime' representing an empty builtin application (i.e. just the
-- builtin with no arguments) by instantiating.
--
-- Applying or type-instantiating a builtin peels off the corresponding constructor from its
-- 'BuiltinRuntime'.
--
-- 'BuiltinResult' contains the cost (an 'ExBudget') and the result (a @MakeKnownM val@) of the
-- builtin application. The cost is stored strictly, since the evaluator is going to look at it
-- and the result is stored lazily, since it's not supposed to be forced before accounting for the
-- cost of the application. If the cost exceeds the available budget, the evaluator discards the
-- the result of the builtin application without ever forcing it and terminates with evaluation
-- failure. Allowing the user to compute something that they don't have the budget for would be a
-- major bug.
--
-- Evaluators that ignore the entire concept of costing (e.g. the CK machine) may of course force
-- the result of the builtin application unconditionally.
