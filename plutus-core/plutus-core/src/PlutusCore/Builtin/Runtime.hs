-- | A 'BuiltinRuntime' represents a possibly partial builtin application.
-- We get an initial 'BuiltinRuntime' representing an empty builtin application (i.e. just the
-- builtin with no arguments) by instantiating (via 'toBuiltinRuntime') a 'BuiltinMeaning'.
--
-- A 'BuiltinRuntime' contains info that is used during evaluation:
--
-- 1. the 'TypeScheme' of the uninstantiated part of the builtin. I.e. initially it's the type
--      scheme of the whole builtin, but applying or type-instantiating the builtin peels off
--      the corresponding constructor from the type scheme
-- 2. the (possibly partially instantiated) denotation
-- 3. the (possibly partially instantiated) costing function
--
-- All the three are in sync in terms of partial instantiatedness due to 'TypeScheme' being a
-- GADT and 'FoldArgs' and 'FoldArgsEx' operating on the index of that GADT.
