-- | The monad that 'makeKnown' runs in.
-- Equivalent to @ExceptT BuiltinError Emitter@, except optimized in two ways:
--
-- 1. everything is strict
-- 2. has the 'BuiltinSuccess' constructor that is used for returning a value with no logs
--    attached, which is the most common case for us, so it helps a lot not to construct and
--    deconstruct a redundant tuple
--
-- Moving from @ExceptT BuiltinError Emitter@ to this data type gave us a speedup of 8% of total
-- evaluation time.
--
-- Logs are represented as a 'DList', because we don't particularly care about the efficiency of
-- logging, since there's no logging on the chain and builtins don't emit much anyway. Otherwise
-- we'd have to use @text-builder@ or @text-builder-linear@ or something of this sort.
