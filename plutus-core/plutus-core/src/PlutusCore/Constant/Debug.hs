{- | 'SomeConstantOf' is a safe version of 'SomeConstantPoly' almost forcing the user to write the
right thing.

A @SomeConstantOf uni f reps@ is a value of existentially instantiated @f@. For instance,
a @SomeConstantOf uni [] reps@ is a list of something (a list of integers or a list of lists
of booleans etc). And a @SomeConstantOf uni (,) reps@ is a tuple of something.

The @reps@ parameter serves two purposes: its main purpose is to specify how the argument
types look on the PLC side (i.e. it's the same thing as with @Opaque term rep@), so that
we can apply the type of built-in lists to a PLC type variable for example. The secondary
purpose is ensuring type safety via indexing: a value of @SomeConstantOf uni f reps@ can be viewed
as a proof that the amount of arguments @f@ expects and the length of @reps@ are the same number
(we could go even further and compute the kind of @f@ from @reps@, but it doesn't seem like
that would give us any more type safety while it certainly would be a more complex thing to do).

The existential Haskell types @f@ is applied to are reified as type tags from @uni@.
Note however that the correspondence between the Haskell types and the PLC ones from @reps@ is
not demanded and this is by design: during evaluation (i.e. on the Haskell side of things)
we always have concrete type tags, but at Plutus compile time an argument to @f@ can be
a Plutus type variable and so we can't establish any connection between the type tag that
we'll end up having at runtime and a Plutus type variable that we have at compile time.
Which also implies that one can specify that a built-in function takes, say, a tuple of a type
variable and a boolean, but in the actual denotation unlift to a tuple of a unit and an integer
(boolean vs integer) and there won't be any Haskell type error for that, let alone a Plutus type
error -- it'll be an evaluation failure, maybe even a delayed one.
So be careful in the denotation of a builtin to unlift its arguments to what you promised to
unlift them to in its type signature.
