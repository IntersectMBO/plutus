{- Note [Motivation for polymorphic built-in functions]
We need to support polymorphism for built-in functions for these reasons:

1. @ifThenElse@ for 'Bool' (being a built-in type rather than a Scott-encoded one) has to be
   polymorphic as its type signature is

       ifThenElse : all a. Bool -> a -> a -> a

   Previously we had 'Bool' as a Scott-encoded type, but this required plenty of supporting machinery,
   because unlifting (aka Scott-decoding) a PLC 'Bool' into a Haskell 'Bool' is quite a non-trivial
   thing, see https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/blob/e222466e6d46bbca9f76243bb496b3c88ed02ca1/language-plutus-core/src/PlutusCore/Constant/Typed.hs#L165-L252

   Now that we got rid of all this complexity we have to pay for that by supporting polymorphic
   built-in functions (but we added that support long ago anyway, 'cause it was easy to do).

2. we may want to add efficient polymorphic built-in types like @IntMap@ or @Vector@ and most functions
   defined over them are polymorphic as well
-}

{- Note [Implemetation of polymorphic built-in functions]
Encoding polymorphism in an AST in an intrinsically-typed manner is not a pleasant thing to do in Haskell.
It's not impossible, see "Embedding F", Sam Lindley: http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/slindley/papers/embedding-f.pdf
But we'd rather avoid such heavy techniques.

Fortunately, there is a simple trick: we have parametricity in Haskell, so a function that is
polymorphic in its argument can't inspect that argument in any way and so we never actually need to
convert such an argument from PLC to Haskell just to convert it back later without ever inspecting
the value. Instead we can keep the argument intact and apply the Haskell function directly to
the PLC AST representing some value.

E.g. Having a built-in function with the following signature:

    reverse : all a. [a] -> [a]

that maps to Haskell's

    reverse :: forall a. [a] -> [a]

evaluation of

    PLC.reverse {bool} (cons true (cons false nil))

proceeds as follows:

      PLC.reverse {bool} (cons true (cons false nil))
    ~ makeKnown (Haskell.reverse (readKnown (cons true (cons false nil))))
    ~ makeKnown (Haskell.reverse [Opaque true, Opaque false])
    ~ makeKnown [Opaque false, Opaque true]
    ~ EvaluationSuccess (cons false (cons true nil))

Note how we use the 'Opaque' wrapper in order to unlift a PLC term as an opaque Haskell value
using 'readKnown' and then lift the term back using 'makeKnown' without ever inspecting the term.

An opaque PLC @term@ whose type is a PLC type variable `a_0` has the following type on the Haskell
side:

    Opaque term (TyVarRep ('TyNameRep "a" 0))

where that last argument is a direct counterpart of the term-level

    TyVar () (TyName (Name "a" 0))

@Opaque term rep@ can be used for passing any @term@ through the builtin application machinery,
not just one whose type is a bound variable. For example, you can define a new data type

    data NatRep

provide a 'KnownTypeAst' instance for it (mapping a @Proxy NatRep@ to the actual type of natural
numbers in PLC) and define a (rather pointless) builtin like @idNat : nat -> nat@.

It's also possible to bind a type variable of a higher-kind, say, @f :: * -> *@ and make a builtin
with the following signature:

    idFInteger : all (f :: * -> *). f integer -> f integer

where the type application is handled with 'TyAppRep'. Note that the latter is defined as a
@data family@:

    data family TyAppRep (fun :: dom -> cod) (arg :: dom) :: cod

We do that because a @data family@ can return a poly-kinded argument, which allows us to get an
intrinsically-kinded representation of PLC types. For example, an opaque @term@ whose type is an
application of a type variable @f@ to a type variable @a@ is represented like this:

    Opaque term (TyAppRep (TyVarRep ('TyNameRep "f" 0)) (TyVarRep ('TyNameRep "a" 1 :: TyNameRep *)))

Note the @TyNameRep *@ kind annotation. It tells us three things:

1. a type-level name has a kind associated with it. The reason for that is that we use names in
binders (for example, in the universal quantifier) and as variables and kinds are important in
both these cases due to us having an intrinsically-kinded representation of types, so it's
convenient to annotate type-level names with kinds. Another reason is that we do not attempt to do
any kind of static analysis on reflected type variables and associating kinds with them allows us
to catch errors like "two variables with equal names and uniques, but different kinds" earlier
2. the kind is not stored as an argument to the @TyNameRep@ constructor. Instead it's stored as
an index of the data type. The point of this is that if we stored the kind as an argument, we'd
have to provide it manually, but since the representation is intrinsically-kinded there's no point
in doing so as GHC can infer all the kinds itself
3. ... apart from cases where they're inherently ambiguous, like in the case above. If we don't
specify the kind of the @a_1@ type variable, then there's no way GHC could infer it as the variable
is passed as an argument to another variable with an unspecified kind (@f_0@)
4. finally, an opaque term can only be of a type of kind @*@. You can't construct a term whose type
is of some other kind. That's why we don't need to annotate the @f_0@ type variable: the domain is
inferred from the kind of the argument (where it's explicitly specified via @TyNameRep *@) and the
codomain is inferred from the fact that the whole type is passed to 'Opaque' and so it has to be
of kind @*@

It would be nice if we didn't need to define that @*Rep@ stuff at the type level just to demote it
to the term level via a type class, but this hasn't been investigated yet. A plausible way would be
to ditch 'KnownTypeAst' (but keep 'KnownType') and provide PLC types manually. But that doesn't seem
to give rise to a terribly nice API. And we'd lose all the static guarantees, which is not a big
deal, but losing the automatic inference of type schemes would suck, given that it's already quite
handy and is going to be improved.

Representing contructors as poly-kinded data families and handling those with open type families
and/or type classes is a way of solving the expression problem for indexed data types at the type
level, if you are into these things.
-}

{- Note [Pattern matching on built-in types]
At the moment we really only support direct pattern matching on enumeration types: 'Void', 'Unit',
'Bool' etc. This is because the denotation of a builtin cannot construct general terms (as opposed
to constants), only juggle the ones that were provided as arguments without changing them.
So e.g. if we wanted to add the following data type:

    newtype AnInt = AnInt Int

as a built-in type, we wouldn't be able to add the following function as its pattern matcher:

    matchAnInt :: AnInt -> (Int -> r) -> r
    matchAnInt (AnInt i) f = f i

because currently we cannot express the @f i@ part using the builtins machinery as that would
require applying an arbitrary Plutus Core function in the denotation of a builtin, which would
allow us to return arbitrary terms from the builtin application machinery, which is something
that we originally had, but decided to abandon due to performance concerns.

But it's still possible to have @AnInt@ as a built-in type, it's just that instead of trying to
make its pattern matcher into a builtin we can have the following builtin:

    anIntToInt :: AnInt -> Int
    anIntToInt (AnInt i) = i

which fits perfectly well into the builtins machinery.

Although that becomes annoying for more complex data types. For tuples we need to provide two
projection functions ('fst' and 'snd') instead of a single pattern matcher, which is not too
bad, but to get pattern matching on lists we need three built-in functions: @null@, @head@ and
@tail@ and to require `Bool` to be in the universe to be able to define a PLC equivalent of

    matchList :: [a] -> r -> (a -> [a] -> r) -> r
    matchList xs z f = if null xs then z else f (head xs) (tail xs)

If a constructor stores more than one value, the corresponding projection function packs them
into a (possibly nested) pair, for example for

    data Data
        = Constr Integer [Data]
        | <...>

we have (pseudocode):

    unConstrData (Constr i ds) = (i, ds)

In order to get pattern matching over 'Data' we need a projection function per constructor as well
as with lists, but writing (where the @Data@ suffix indicates that a function is a builtin that
somehow corresponds to a constructor of 'Data')

    if isConstrData d
        then uncurry fConstr $ unConstrData d
        else if isMapData d
            then fMap $ unMapData d
            else if isListData d
                then fList $ unListData d
                else <...>

is tedious and inefficient and so instead we have a single @chooseData@ builtin that matches on
its @Data@ argument and chooses the appropriate branch (type instantiations and strictness concerns
are omitted for clarity):

     chooseData
        (uncurry fConstr $ unConstrData d)
        (fMap $ unMapData d)
        (fList $ unListData d)
        <...>
        d

which, for example, evaluates to @fMap es@ when @d@ is @Map es@

On the bright side, this encoding of pattern matchers does work, so maybe it's indeed worth to
prioritize performance over convenience, especially given the fact that performance is of a concern
to every single end user while the inconvenience is only a concern for the compiler writers and
we don't add complex built-in types too often.
-}

{- Note [Representable built-in functions over polymorphic built-in types]
In Note [Pattern matching on built-in types] we talked about how general higher-order polymorphic
built-in functions are troubling, but polymorphic built-in functions can be troubling even in
the first-order case. In a Plutus program we always pair constants of built-in types with their
tags from the universe, which means that in order to produce a constant embedded into a program
we need the tag of the type of that constant. We can't get that tag from a Plutus type -- those
are gone at runtime, so the only place we can get a type tag from during evaluation is some already
existing constant. I.e. the following built-in function is representable:

    tail : all a. [a] -> [a]

because for constructing the result we need a type tag for @[a]@, but we have a value of that type
as an argument and so we can extract the type tag from it. Same applies to

    swap : all a b. (a, b) -> (b, a)

since 'SomeConstantOf' always contains a type tag for each type that a polymorphic built-in type is
instantiated with and so constructing a type tag for @(b, a)@ given type tags for @a@ and @b@ is
unproblematic.

And so neither

    cons : all a. a -> [a] -> [a]

is troubling (even though that ones requires checking at runtime that the element to be prepended
is of the same type as the type of the elements of the list as it's impossible to enforce this kind
of type safety in Haskell over possibly untyped PLC).

However consider the following imaginary builtin:

    nil : all a. [a]

we can't represent it for two reasons:

1. we don't have any argument providing us a type tag for @a@ and hence we can't construct a type
   tag for @[a]@
2. it would be a very unsound builtin to have. We can only instantiate built-in types with other
   built-in types and so allowing @nil {some_non_built_in_type}@ would be a lie that couldn't reduce
   to anything since it's not even possible to represent a built-in list with non-built-in elements
   (even if there's zero of them)

"Wait, but wouldn't @cons {some_non_built_in_type}@ be a lie as well?" -- No! Since @cons@ does not
just construct a list filled with elements of a non-built-in type but also expects one as an
argument and providing such an argument is impossible, 'cause it's pretty much the same thing as
populating 'Void' -- both values are equally unrepresentable. And so @cons {some_non_built_in_type}@
is a way to say @absurd@, which is perfectly fine to have.

Finally,

    comma :: all a b. a -> b -> (a, b)

is representable (because we can require arguments to be constants carrying universes with them,
which we can use to construct the resulting universe), but is still a lie, because instantiating
that builtin with non-built-in types is possible and so the PLC type checker won't throw on such
an instantiation, which will become 'EvalutionFailure' at runtime the moment unlifting of a
non-constant is attempted when a constant is expected.

So could we still get @nil@ or a safe version of @comma@ somehow? Well, we could have this
weirdness:

    nilOfTypeOf : all a. [a] -> [a]

i.e. ask for an already existing list, but ignore the actual list and only use the type tag.

But since we're ignoring the actual list, can't we just not pass it in the first place? And instead
pass around our good old friends, singletons. We should be able to do that, but it hasn't been
investigated. Perhaps something along the lines of adding the following constructor to 'DefaultUni':

    DefaultUniProtoSing :: DefaultUni (Esc (Proxy @GHC.Type))

and then defining

    nil : all a. sing a -> [a]

and then the Plutus Tx compiler can provide a type class or something for constructing singletons
for built-in types.

{- | 'SomeConstantOf' is similar to 'SomeConstant': while the latter is for unlifting any
constants, the former is for unlifting constants of a specific polymorphic built-in type
(the @f@ parameter).

A @SomeConstantOf uni f reps@ is a value of existentially instantiated @f@. For instance,
a @SomeConstantOf uni [] reps@ is a list of something (a list of integers or a list of lists
of booleans etc). And a @SomeConstantOf uni (,) reps@ is a tuple of something.

The @reps@ parameter serves two purposes: its main purpose is to specify how the argument
types look on the PLC side (i.e. it's the same thing as with @Opaque term rep@), so that
we can apply the type of built-in lists to a PLC type variable for example. The secondary
purpose is ensuring type safety via indexing: a value of @SomeConstantOf uni f reps@ can be viewed
as a proof that the amount of arguments @f@ expects and the length of @reps@ are the same number
(we could go even further and compute the kind of @f@ from @reps@, but it doesn't seem like
that would give us any more type safety while it certainly would be a more complex thing to do).

The existential Haskell types @f@ is applied to are reified as type tags from @uni@.
Note however that the correspondence between the Haskell types and the PLC ones from @reps@ is
not demanded and this is by design: during evaluation (i.e. on the Haskell side of things)
we always have concrete type tags, but at Plutus compile time an argument to @f@ can be
a Plutus type variable and so we can't establish any connection between the type tag that
we'll end up having at runtime and a Plutus type variable that we have at compile time.
Which also implies that one can specify that a built-in function takes, say, a tuple of a type
variable and a boolean, but in the actual denotation unlift to a tuple of a unit and an integer
(boolean vs integer) and there won't be any Haskell type error for that, let alone a Plutus type
error -- it'll be an evaluation failure, maybe even a delayed one.
So be careful in the denotation of a builtin to unlift its arguments to what you promised to
unlift them to in its type signature.

unlifting constants fo type 'Int' and fail with an evaluation failure (via 'AsEvaluationFailure')

internal one -- it's a normal evaluation failure, but unlifting errors have this connotation of
