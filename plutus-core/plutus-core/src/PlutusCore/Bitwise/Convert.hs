{- Note [Manual specialization]
For both integerToByteString and byteStringToInteger, we have to perform very
similar operations, but with small variations:

- Most-significant-first versus most-significant-last (for both)
- Whether we have a size limit or not (for integerToByteString)

Additionally, loop sectioning (see Note [Loop sectioning]) requires us to have
separate 'big-stride' and 'small-stride' operations to ensure universality of
input handling. Lastly, we have several subroutines (digit extraction, for
instance) that may vary in similar ways. In such a case, generalization by
means of abstraction seems like a good idea, as the operations (and
subroutines) vary little.

At the same time, to determine which variation of any given function (or
subroutine) we need, we only have to scrutinize the relevant argument(s) once:
these specifics (such as byte order) don't change during the course of the
operation. Thus, we want to make sure that these checks in the code are _also_
performed only once, ideally at the beginning.

However, if we write such operations naively as so:

> subroutine byteOrder arg1 arg2 = case byteOrder of
>       LittleEndian -> ...
>       BigEndian -> ...

the byteOrder argument will be scrutinized on each call of subroutine. This is
correct in general (as there is no guarantee that the argument will be stable).
Strangely, however, even in a case like this one:

> mainRoutine byteOrder arg1 arg2 = ...
>    where
>       subroutine arg3 = case byteOrder of
>           LittleEndian -> ...
>           BigEndian -> ...

GHC _still_ re-scrutinizes byteOrder in every call of subroutine! This penalty
can be somewhat lessened using a form similar to this:

> mainRoutine byteOrder arg1 arg2 = ...
>     where
>        !subroutine = case byteOrder of
>             LittleEndian -> \arg3 -> ...
>             BigEndian -> \arg3 -> ...

but this is _still_ between 20 and 30% worse than doing something like this:

> mainRoutine byteOrder arg1 arg2 = case byteOrder of
>     LittleEndian -> [code calling subroutineLE where needed]
>     BigEndian -> [code calling subroutineBE where needed]
>     where
>         subroutineLE arg3 = ...
>         subroutineBE arg3 = ...

This form _ensures_ we scrutinize (and branch) only the number of times we have
to, and in a predictable place. Since these are backends for Plutus Core primops,
and performance is thus critical, we choose to use this manually-specialized form
for each combination of relevant arguments. While this is repetitive, and thus
also somewhat error-prone, the performance penalty for not doing this is
unacceptable.

{- Note [Loop sectioning]
Both integerToByteString and byteStringToInteger effectively function as loops
over digits (and thus, individual bytes), which either have to be read or
extracted. In particular, this involves trafficking data between memory and
machine registers (both ByteString and Integer are wrappers around counted
arrays), as well as the overhead of looping (involving comparisons and branches).

However, on all architectures of interest (essentially, 64-bit Tier 1),
general-purpose registers (GPRs henceforth) are 64 bits (or 8 bytes).
Furthermore, the primary cost of moving data between memory and registers is
having to overcome the 'memory wall': the exact amount of data being moved
doesn't affect this very much. In addition to this, when we operate on single
bytes, the remaining 56 bits of the GPR holding that data are essentially
'wasted'. In the situation we have (namely, operating over arrays, whose data
is adjacent in memory), we thus get two sources of inefficiency:

* Despite paying the cost for a memory transfer, we transfer only one-eighth
  the data we could; and
* Despite transferring data from memory to registers, we utilize the register
  at only one-eighth capacity.

This essentially means we perform _eight times_ more rotations of the loop,
and memory moves, than we need to!

To avoid this inefficiency, we use a technique known as _loop sectioning_.
Effectively, this turns our homogenous loop (that always operates one byte at
a time) into a heterogenous loop: first, we operate on a larger section (called
a _stride_) until we can no longer do this, and then we finish up using byte
at a time processing. Essentially, when given an input like this:

[ b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7, b8, b9, b10 ]

the homogeous byte-at-a-time approach would process it like so:

  _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _   _
[ b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7, b8, b9, b10 ]

for a total of 10 memory transfers and 10 loop spins, whereas a loop-sectioned
approach with a stride of 8 would instead process like so:

  ______________________________  _   _
[ b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7, b8, b9, b10 ]

Giving us only _three_ memory transfers and _three_ loop spins instead. This
effectively reduces our work by a factor of 8. In our cases, this is almost
free, as there is no data processing to be done: all we need to do is copy
from one place to another, essentially.

This technique only benefits us because counted arrays are cache-friendly: see
Note [Superscalarity and caching] for a longer explanation of this and why it
matters.

{- Note [Superscalarity and caching]
On modern architectures, in order to process data, it must first be moved from
memory into a register. This operation has some cost (known as the 'memory wall'),
which is largely independent of how much data gets moved (assuming the register
can hold it): moving one byte, or a whole register's worth, costs about the same.
To reduce this cost, CPU manufacturers have introduced _cache hierarchies_,
which are designed to limit the cost of the wall, as long as the data access
matches the cache's optimal usage pattern. Thus, while an idealized view of
the memory hierachy is this:

Registers
---------
Memory

in reality, the view is more like this:

Registers
---------
L1 cache
---------
L2 cache

Each 'higher' cache in the hierarchy is smaller, but faster, and when a memory
fetch is requested in code, in addition to moving the requested data to a
register, that data (plus some more) is moved into caches as well. The amount
of data moved into cache (a _cache line_) is typically eight machine words on
modern architectures (and definitely is the case for all Tier 1 GHC platforms):
for the cases concerning Plutus, that is 64 bytes. Therefore, if data we need
soon after a fetch is _physically_ nearby, it won't need to be fetched from
memory: instead, it would come from a cache, which is faster (by a considerable
margin).

To see how this can matter, consider the following ByteString:

[ b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7, b8, b9, b10, b11 ]

The ByteString (being a counted array) has all of its data physically adjacent
to each other. Suppose we wanted to fetch the byte at index 1 (second position).
The naive view of what happens is like this:

Registers: [b2] [ ] [ ] .... [ ]
Memory: [ b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7, b8, b9, b10, b11 ]

Thus, it would appear that, if we wanted a different position's value, we would
need to fetch from memory again. However, what _actually_ happens is more like this:

Registers: [b2] [ ] [ ] .... [ ]
L1 cache: [ b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7, b8, b9, b10, b11 ]
Memory: [ b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7, b8, b9, b10, b11 ]

We note that b2, as well as its adjacent elements, were _all_ pulled into the L1
cache. This can only work because all these elements are physically adjacent in
memory. The improvement in performance from this cache use is _very_ non-trivial:
an L1 cache is about 200 times faster than a memory access, and an L2 cache about
20 times faster.

To take further advantage of this, modern CPUs (and all Tier 1 GHC platforms have
this capability) are _superscalar_. To explain what this means, let's consider the
naive view of how CPUs execute instructions: namely, it is one-at-a-time, and
synchronous. While CPUs must give the _appearance_ that they behave this way, in
practice, CPU execution is very much asynchronous: due to the proliferation of ALUs
on a single chip, having twice as many processing units is much cheaper than having
processing units run twice as fast. Thus, if there are no data dependencies
between instructions, CPUs can (and do!) execute them simultaneously, stalling to
await results if a data dependency is detected. This can be done automatically
using Tomasulo's algorithm, which ensures no conflicts with maximum throughput.

Superscalarity interacts well with the cache hierarchy, as it makes data more
easily available for processing, provided there is enough 'work to do', and no
data dependencies. In our situation, most of what we do is data _movement_ from
one memory location to another, which by its very nature lacks any data
dependencies.
