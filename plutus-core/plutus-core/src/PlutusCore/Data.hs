{- Note [Encoding via Term]
We want to write a custom encoder/decoder for Data (i.e. not use the Generic version), but actually
doing this is a pain. So instead we go via the CBOR 'Term' representation, which lets us process a
more structured representation, which is a lot easier.

{- Note [CBOR alternative tags]
We've proposed to add additional tags to the CBOR standard to cover (essentially) sum types.
This is exactly what we need to encode the 'Constr' constructor of 'Data' in an unambiguous way.

The tags aren't *quite* accepted yet, but they're clearly going to accept so we might as well
start using them.

The scheme is:
- Alternatives 0-6 -> tags 121-127, followed by the arguments in a list
- Alternatives 7-127 -> tags 1280-1400, followed by the arguments in a list
- Any alternatives, including those that don't fit in the above -> tag 102 followed by a list
containing an unsigned integer for the actual alternative, and then the arguments in a (nested!)
list.
-}

{- Note [The 64-byte limit]
We impose a 64-byte *on-the-wire* limit on the leaves of a serialized 'Data'. This prevents people
from inserting Mickey Mouse entire.

The simplest way of doing this is to check during deserialization that we never deserialize
something that uses more than 64-bytes, and this is largely what we do. Then it's the user's problem
to not produce something too big.

But this is quite inconvenient, so see Note [Evading the 64-byte limit] for how we get around this.
-}

{- Note [Evading the 64-byte limit]
Implementing Note [The 64-byte limit] naively would be quite annoying:
- Users would be responsible for not creating Data values with leaves that were too big.
- If a script *required* such a thing (e.g. a counter that somehow got above 64 bytes), then the
user is totally stuck: the script demands something they cannot represent.

This is unpleasant and introduces limits. Probably limits that nobody will hit, but it's nicer to
just not have them.
And it turns out that we can evade the problem with some clever encoding.

The fundamental trick is that an *indefinite-length* CBOR bytestring is just as obfuscated as a list
of bytestrings, since it consists of a list of definite-length chunks, and each definite-length
chunk must be *tagged* (at least with the size).
So we get a sequence like:

   <list start>
   <chunk length metadata>
   <chunk>
   <chunk length metadata>
   ...
   <list end>

The chunk length metadata has a prescribed format, such that it's difficult to manipulate it so that
it matches your "desired" data.
So this effectively breaks up the bytestring in much the same way as a list of <64 byte bytestrings.

So that solves the problem for bytestrings on the encoding side:
- if they are <=64 bytes, we can just encode them as a normal bytestring
- if they are >64 bytes, we encode them as indefinite-length bytestrings with 64-byte chunks

On the decoding side, we need to check when we decode that we never decode a definite-length
bytestring of >64 bytes. That covers our two cases:
- Short definite-length bytestrings are fine
- Long indefinite-length bytestrings are just made of short definite-length bytestings.

Unfortunately this all means that we have to write our own encoders/decoders so we can produce
chunks of the right size and check the sizes when we decode, but that's okay. Users need to do the
same thing: anyone encoding `Data` with their own encoders who doesn't split up big bytestrings in
this way will get failures when we decode them.

For integers, we have two cases. Small integers (<=64bits) can be encoded normally. Big integers are
already encoded *with a byte string*. The spec allows this to be an indefinite-length bytestring
(although cborg doesn't like it), so we can reuse our trick.
Again, we need to write some manual encoders/decoders.

{- Note [Definite and indefinite forms of CBOR]
CBOR is annoying and you can have both definite (with a fixed length) and indefinite lists, maps,
etc.

So we have to be careful to handle both cases when decoding. When encoding we mostly don't make
the indefinite kinds, but see Note [Avoiding the 64-byte limit] for some cases where we do.
