-- The subtlety here is that the nest call surrounds the first delimiter and the content, but not
-- the final one. This is because of how nest behaves, where it doesn't indent until it hits
-- the first line break. So we need to include the first delimiter so that the main content gets
-- indented, but not the final delimiter.

  -- and a line-or-space, but end with a line-or-nothing and ")".
