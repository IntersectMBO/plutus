-- Every polymorphic function ignores the memory annotation of its argument. This is due to the fact
-- that no function duplicates the AST and so threading an argument through a function or dropping
-- it completely does not increase memory consumption. It does not seem to be possible to define
-- a function that duplicates the AST of its argument with the current set of built-in types,
-- but once we have lists in the universe, that should be easy to do. Once there's a duplicating
-- function, should we multiple memory consumption by the number of duplicates it returns minus one?
-- For example, should @\x -> [x, x]@ increase memory consumption by the memory annotation of @x@
-- just once and not twice, since one of the @x@s is going to be essentially reused and the other
-- one will be a true duplicate? Or should memory consumption stay the same regardless of the
-- number of duplicates (modulo whatever the spine of the freshly list takes up)? Since
--
-- 1. later we can call @head@ over the resulting list thus not duplicating anything in the end
-- 2. any monomorphic builtin forcing a 'Constant' node of the duplicated AST will automatically
--    add it to the current budget. And if we never touch the duplicate again and just keep it
--    around, then it won't ever increase memory consumption. And any other node will be taken into
--    account automatically as well: just think that having @\x -> f x x@ as a PLC term is supposed
--    to be handled correctly by design
