{- Note [Recursion Control and geAstSize]
One would be forgiven for thinking that you don't need `geAstSize` in `GenTm` because size is
built-in to 'Gen'. However, if you use 'Gen's built-in size to control the size of both the terms
you generate *and* the size of the constants in the terms you will end up with skewed
terms. Constants near the top of the term will be big and constants near the bottom of the term will
be small. For this reason we follow QuickCheck best practise and keep track of the "recursion
control size" separately from 'Gen's size in the 'geAstSize' field of the 'GenEnv'
environment. I.e. we let the QuickCheck's size parameter to be responsible for the size of constants
at the leaves of the AST and use 'geAstSize' to control the size of the AST itself.

-- * Names

{- Note [Chaotic Good fresh name generation]
Currently we don't use 'Quote' for generating fresh names in the QuickCheck generators. It's mostly
for historical reasons and it's very non-trivial to change the current alignment to use 'Quote' at
this point. It does have positive sides to it, though, which we'll discuss below.

So what we do right now is track all names that are in the scope (not all actually and not in the
scope, more on that later, for now let's pretend the statement is correct) in separate maps:

- one for type names
- one for term names
- one for datatype-associated names (the name of the data type, its matcher and constructors)

and all these maps are processed in a linear fashion each time we need to generate a bunch of fresh
names. The processing is done via collecting in a set all uniques of names found in the maps: the
key sets of all the three maps and the names in the elements of the data map. Why do we need the
latter given that the names there are present as keys in the term map? No idea.

What makes it hard to change the current alignment to use 'Quote' is that names are generated all
over the place and put into the current context, inside and outside of the 'GenTm' monad. Any
operation on the context automatically makes the name generation machinery aware of the changes,
because the machinery looks at the whole context each time. It's really hard to move all of that to
run in 'Quote' simply because it’s trivial to miss a call here and there and types don't help much.

Another challenge is that the current fresh name generation is pretty fancy and doesn’t just always
pick the next fresh name. It can pick the next 10th fresh name, then go back, then again forward etc
– all of that between different calls to the function generating fresh names. We want to keep this
logic as it allows us to produce more diverse terms. We probably can simulate this kind of logic
with 'Quote', but it's non-trivial for sure.

Finally, we do not have any function that generates a definitely fresh name or a function that
generates a definitely non-fresh name -- both for very technical reasons (see the docs inline).
This likely isn't intentional, but it's hard to change that at this point and we don't care much
anyway, name clashes are fine. Moreover, the term map rather than containing all term names that
are in the scope only contains those that can be correctly inserted into the program (i.e. don't
reference shadowed type variables in their type). However the data map isn't filtered the same way
as the term map and so there can be constructors whose type references shadowed type variables,
which we never notice because those are only used for fresh name generation... which I guess is how
looking at the elements of the data map isn't redundant in the end.

Overall, this chaotic goodness needs to be sorted out.

{- Note [Warning about generating fresh names]
Since 'GenTm' is a *reader* monad names are not immediately put into any state when generated.
In order to bind generated names you need to use functions like 'bindTyName' and 'bindTmName', e.g.

    genLam k1 k2 = do
        x <- genMaybeFreshTyName "a"
        --                                              v--- LOOK HERE!
        fmap (TyLam () x k1) $ onAstSize (subtract 1) $ bindTyName x k1 (genType k2)
