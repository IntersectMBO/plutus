{- Note [The unification algorithm]
Type unification expects a context (mapping from type variables to their kinds) and a set of
flexible type variables, also called metas (those that can get resolved). The context is used for
kind checking solutions as well as generation of fresh variables.

Internally type unification maintains a set of locals ('TyLam'- or 'TyForall'-bound variables
encountered during unification). Those are stored in a reader monad, since they depend on the
current scope and need to be adjusted when the scope changes, which is best modelled by a reader
monad.

Type unification also maintains a substitution (mapping from a possibly empty subset of metas to
their instantiations) and eventually that substitution is returned as a result of unification. The
substitution is passed around in a state monad, since unification results in one part of the
unification problem are relevant in all the other parts too (this is not in conflict with locals
being scope-specific, because flexible variable resolution cannot capture a locally bound
variable). Type unification could take a substitution as an input and extend it instead of always
making the initial substitution empty, but we didn't need this extra functionality, so we didn't
implement it for the sake of keeping the interface to the unifier simpler.

Type unification proceeds by recursion on the spines of the two types. We don't attempt to do
higher-order unification at all, so we don't have the usual unification business like pruning,
blocking, pattern unification etc. In particular, in our setting two type applications can unify
only if the functions and the arguments unify separately (with higher-order unification it would be
possible to unify type applications whose function parts differ, because functions compute and the
results may unify even if the functions don't).

We handle 'TyIFix' and 'TyFun' the same way as type applications by decomposing them into their
constituents and unifying them separately. These two would look the same in a higher-order setting.

'TyLam' and 'TyForall' being binders require a bit of special care: we rename the bound variables in
the bodies of the binders, so that the two sides of the unification equation bind the same variable,
see Note [Renaming during unification]. We do not attempt to perform unification modulo eta.

Two 'TyBuiltin's unify when they are the same built-in type.

The only remaining case is when one of the sides is a type variable (or both). There's a number of
checks that we perform in order to ensure that it's fine to resolve the variable as the given type,
those are documented alongside the code performing the checks.
-}

{- Note [Renaming during unification]
When we go under twin binders, we rename the variables that the binders introduce, so that they have
the same name. This requires travering both the sides of the unification problem before unification
can proceed. This is inefficient, instead we could do the same thing that we do for checking
equality and keep two separate maps tracking renamings of local variables. Although the types AST is
lazy, so maybe it's not a big deal in the end. Although even with laziness, we still have quadratic
behavior currently.

Note that generating a new name is also a rather expensive operation requiring to traverse the whole
context, so that's another source of inefficiency.
