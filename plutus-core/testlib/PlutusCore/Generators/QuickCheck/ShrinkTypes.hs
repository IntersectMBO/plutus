{- Note [Avoiding Shrinking Loops]

   Shrinking loops can be tricky to deal with and unfortunately there is no
   golden rule for how to avoid them. However, one good strategy to avoid them
   is to make sure shrinking isn't doing anything too clever. As a general set of
   rules:
   * Don't do "special case" shrinking that trades off size in one subterm for size
     in a different subterm. For example, it's generally dangerous to shrink
     `Node (Node Leaf (Node Leaf Leaf)) (Node Leaf Leaf)` to
     `Node Leaf (Node Leaf (Node Leaf Leaf))` even though the number of leaves is
     decreasing unless you've explicitly made "the number of leaves decreases" the
     measure by which you're shrinking (in which case you need to have a property for
     this!)
   * Carefully guard base cases - the shrinker
     `shrink tree = Leaf : someCleverShrinkingStrategy` will loop, while
     `shrink tree = [ Leaf | tree /= Leaf ] ++ someCleverShrinkingStrategy` will not.
     You will see this kind of thing used below wherever we use `minimalType` and `mkHelp`
     in the shrinkers.
   * Write properties to test your shrinkers and *run them when you change your shrinkers*.
     See e.g. `prop_noTermShrinkLoops` in module `GeneratorSpec`.

-- Note that compared to 'genAtomicType' this one for, say, @* -> * -> *@ always gives @pair@, while
-- 'genAtomicType' can give you a type variable, 'pair' or a type lambda returning a type variable,
-- 'list' or a type lambda returning a type variable or a built-in type of kind @*@.
-- | Give a unique "least" (intentionally vaguely specified by "shrinking order")
-- type of that kind. Note: this function requires care and attention to not get
-- a shrinking loop. If you think you need to mess with this function:
-- 0. First, you *must* read the note Note [Avoiding Shrinking Loops]
-- 1. You're probably wrong, think again and
-- 2. If you're sure you're not wrong you need to be very careful and
--    test the shrinking to make sure you don't get in a loop.
