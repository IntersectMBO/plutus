{- Note [Scoping tests API]
If you want to test how a certain pass handles scoping you should use either 'test_scopingGood' or
'test_scopingBad' depending on whether the pass is expected to preserve global uniqueness and not
change scoping of its argument. Regarding the last one: substitution, for example, may remove free
variables and scoping tests, being initially developed only to test renamers, will fail upon seeing
that a free variable was removed. So any scoping test failure needs to be carefully scrutinized
before concluding that it reveals a bug.

As it turns out, most AST transformations don't do anything that would cause the scoping tests to
false-positively report a bug:

- a lot of passes simply do not do anything with names apart from maybe moving them around
- those that do change names may produce alpha-equivalent results and this is one thing that the
  scoping machinery is designed to test
- some passes such as inlining may duplicate binders, but that is also fine as long as the
  duplicates are properly renamed, since the scoping machinery doesn't count binders or variable
  usages, it only expects free names to stay free, bound names to change together with their binders
  and global uniqueness to be preserved (see 'ScopeError' for the full list of possible errors)
- some passes such as inlining may remove bindings and there's special support implemented for
  handling this: when invoking either 'test_scopingGood' or 'test_scopingBad' you need to provide a
  'BindingRemoval' argument specifying whether binding removal is expected for the pass. Conversily,
  make it 'BindingRemovalOk' whenever you use 'test_scopingBad' to emphasize that even with binding
  removal allowed tests still fail
- some passes do not perform renaming of the input themselves, in that case you need to provide
  'PrerenameYes' for the 'Prerename' argument that both the test runners expect. It doesn't matter
  whether the pass relies on global uniqueness itself, because the scoping tests rely on it anyway.
  If the pass renames its input, and only in this case, provide 'PrerenameNo' for the 'Prerename'
  argument, this will allow the scoping tests to ensure that the pass does indeed rename its input
- due to a very specific design of the scoping tests some passes don't give false positives, but
  don't get tested properly either. For example dead code elimination is a no-op within the scoping
  tests, because internally all types/terms/programs only contain bindings that get referenced

There's also 'test_scopingSpoilRenamer', this one is used to test that the scoping tests do catch
various kinds of bugs. Don't use it with any passes that aren't renamers.

All in all, in order to use the scoping tests you have to understand how they work, which is an
unfortunate but seemingly inevitable requirement. On the bright side, it's worth the effort, because
the tests do catch bugs occasionally.

Whenever you use 'test_scopingBad' make sure to explain why, so that it's clear whether there's
something wrong with the pass or it's just a limitation of the scoping tests.
