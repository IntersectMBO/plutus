---------------- Cloning objects ----------------
-- TODO: look at GHC.Compact

{- | In some cases (for example, equality testing) the worst-case behaviour of a
builtin will be when it has two identical arguments However, there's a danger
that if the arguments are physically identical (ie, they are (pointers to) the
same object in the heap) the underlying implementation may notice that and
return immediately.  The code below attempts to avoid this by producing a
completely new copy of an integer.  Experiments with 'realyUnsafePtrEquality#`
indicate that it does what's required (in fact, `cloneInteger n = (n+1)-1` with
NOINLINE suffices, but that's perhaps a bit too fragile).

   function that looks at the result, so eg unsafeEvaluateCek won't work
   properly because it returns a pair whose components won't be evaluated by
   whnf.  We can't use nf because it does too much work: for instance if it gets
   back a 'Data' value it'll traverse all of it.

---------------- Creating benchmarks ----------------

{- | The use of bgroups in the functions below will cause Criterion to give the
   benchmarks names like "AddInteger/ExMemory 11/ExMemory 5": these are saved in
   the CSV file and the 'benchData' function in 'models.R' subsequently extracts
   the names and memory figures for use as entries in the data frame used to
   generate the cost models.  Hence changing the nesting of the bgroups would
   cause trouble elsewhere.

{- | Given a builtin function f of type a * b -> _ together with lists xs::a and

   ys'.  This can be used when the worst-case execution time of a two-argument
   builtin is known to occur when it is given two identical arguments (for
   example equality testing, where the function has to examine the whole of both
   inputs in that case; with unequal arguments it will usually be able to return
   more quickly).  The caller may wish to ensure that the elements of the two
   lists are physically different to avoid early return if a builtin can spot
   that its arguments both point to the same heap object.
