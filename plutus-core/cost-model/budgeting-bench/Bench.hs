---------------- Creating benchmarks ----------------

{- | The use of bgroups in the functions below will cause Criterion to give the
   benchmarks names like "AddInteger/ExMemory 11/ExMemory 5": these are saved in
   the CSV file and the 'benchData' function in 'models.R' subsequently extracts
   the names and memory figures for use as entries in the data frame used to
   generate the cost models.  Hence changing the nesting of the bgroups would
   cause trouble elsewhere.
 -}


{- | Given a builtin function f of type a * b -> _ together with lists xs::[a] and
   ys::[b] (along with their memory sizes), create a collection of benchmarks
   which run f on all pairs in {(x,y}: x in xs, y in ys}. -}
createTwoTermBuiltinBench
    :: (DefaultUni `Includes` a, DefaultUni `Includes` b)

createTwoTermBuiltinBench name xs ys =
    bgroup (show name) $ [bgroup (show xmem) [mkBM yMem x y | (y, yMem) <- ys] | (x,xmem) <- xs]
        where mkBM yMem x y = runTermBench (show yMem) $ mkApp2 name x y

{- | Given a builtin function f of type a * a -> _ together with lists xs::a and
   ys::a (along with their memory sizes), create a collection of benchmarks
   which run f on all pairs in 'zip xs ys'.  This can be used when the
   worst-case execution time of a two-argument builtin is known to occur when it
   is given two identical arguments (for example equality testing, where the
   function has to examine the whole of both inputs in that case; with unequal
   arguments it will usually be able to return more quickly).  The caller may
   wish to ensure that the elements of the two lists are physically different to
   avoid early return if a builtin can spot that its arguments both point to the
   same heap object.

-- Generate a random n-word (ie, 64n-bit) integer

        (ms,g2) = makeSizedIntegers ns g1
    in (m:ms,g2)

{- For benchmarking functions with integer arguments we provide a list of random
   integers with 1,3,5,...,31 words.  Experiments suggest that these give us good
   models of the behaviour of functions for "reasonable" inputs (which will in
   fact probably only occupy one word).  We still need to guard against denial
   of service, and we may need to impose penalties for *really* large inputs. -}

{- Some larger inputs for cases where we're using the same number for both
   arguments.  (A) If we're not examining all NxN pairs then we can eaxmine
   larger arguments without taking too much time. (B) for things like EqInteger
   the results are very uniform with the smaller numbers, leading to occasional
   models with negative slopes.  Using larger numbers may help to avoid this. -}
