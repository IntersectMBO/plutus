{- TODO: we're using Hedgehog for some things, QuickCheck for others, and
   System.Random for others.  We should rationalise this.  Pehaps Hedgehog is
   more future-proof since it can produce random instances of a wide variety of
   types.  On the other hand, you have to be careful with Hedgehog Ranges since
   they don't necessarily do what you might expect.  It might be a bit tricky to
   use Hedgehog everywhere because we'd need a lot of monadic code to take care
   of generator states. -}


---------------- Creating things of a given size ----------------

-- Generate a random n-word (ie, 64n-bit) integer
{- In principle a random 5-word integer (for example) might only occupy 4 or
   fewer words, but we're generating uniformly distributed values so the
   probability of that happening should be at most 1 in 2^64. -}

    in (m:ms,g2)

-- Create a bytestring whose memory usage is n.  Since we measure memory usage
-- in 64-bit words we have to create a bytestring containing 8*n bytes.

-- TODO: don't use Hedgehog's 'sample' below: it silently resizes the generator
-- to size 30, so listOfSizedByteStrings and listOfByteStrings are biased
-- towards low byte values.

---------------- Strings (Hedgehog) ----------------

{- This makes a Text string containing n unicode characters.  We use the unicode
 generator since that mostly produces 4 bytes per character, which is the worst
 case. If we were to use the ascii generator that would give us two bytes per
 character.  See Note [Choosing the inputs for costing benchmarks] in Strings.hs. -}

{- | Generate a valid UTF-8 bytestring with memory usage approximately n for
   benchmarking decodeUtf8.  We use the 'unicode' generator beacuse that gives
   the worst-case behaviour: see Note [Choosing the inputs for costing
   benchmarks] in Strings.hs).-}

---------------- Data (QuickCheck) ----------------

{- Create a large Integer.  QuckCheck doesn't provide this by default (and
 arbitrary :: Gen Integer behaves oddly if you resize it to large values like
 2^62 ("negative size" error ), 2^63 (never terminates), or 2^64 or larger
 (always returns 0).  We need really big integers, so we generate a (signed
 64-bit) Int and list of unsigned Word64 values and make them into an Integer
 using bit operations. This is designed so that arbitraryBigInteger n returns
 integers with memoryUsage equal to n.
 -}
genBigInteger :: Int -> Gen Integer
genBigInteger n = do
  body :: [Word64] <- vectorOf (n-1) arbitrary
  first :: Int64 <- arbitrary
  pure $ foldl' go (fromIntegral first) body
      where go :: Integer -> Word64 -> Integer

  I <$> genBigInteger n

{- | Generate an arbitrary bytestring of size n (words) -}
genB :: Int -> Gen Data
genB n = do
  let size = 4*n
  B <$> resize size arbitrary

{- | Generate an arbitrary Data object of depth at most n containing btyrestrings
   with memory usage bmem and integers with memory usage imem.  The `memUsage`
   instance for Data can only return a single number, and we could have for
   example a deep tree containing small bytsetrings/integers which has exactly
   the same memory usage as an object consisting of a single B constructor with
   a very large bytestring.  The costing function for certain operations
   (specifically 'equalsData') would assign the same cost to processing both
   objects even though they have very different structures.  This generator
   allows us to explore a large space of objects to see how the costs of
   operations vary with the size.  For size 5 we generally get trees of depth 3
   and up to 4000 nodes in total (although skewed towards smaller numbers of
   nodes); for size 10 we get trees of depth 4 and up to about 20000 nodes; for
   size 20, depth 5 and up to about one million nodes.
