---------------- Signature verification ----------------

-- Signature verification functions.  Wrong input sizes cause error, time should
-- be otherwise independent of correctness/incorrectness of signature.

-- For VerifyEd25519Signature, for speed purposes it shouldn't matter if the
-- signature and public key are correct as long as they're the correct sizes
-- (256 bits/32 bytes for keys, 512 bytes/64 bits for signatures).

-- TODO: this seems suspicious.  The benchmark results seem to be pretty much
-- constant (a few microseconds) irrespective of the size of the input, but I'm
-- pretty certain that you need to look at every byte of the input to verify the
-- signature.  If you change the size of the public key then it takes three
-- times as long, but the 'verify' implementation checks the size and fails
-- immediately if the key or signature has the wrong size. [This is possibly due
-- to the fact that the underlying C implementation is *extremely* fast, but
-- there's quite a bit of error handling when an argument is the wrong size.
-- However in the latter case the program will terminate anyway, so we don't
-- care about costing it accurately.] Just to be sure, check the results, maybe
-- try with bigger inputs.
