---------------- Calibration ----------------

{- We want the benchmark results to reflect only the time taken to evaluate a
   builtin, not the startup costs of the CEK machine or the overhead incurred
   while collecting the arguments (applyEvaluate/ forceEvaluate etc).  We
   benchmark the no-op builtins Nop1, Nop2, and Nop3 and in the R code we
   subtract the costs of those from the time recorded for the real builtins.
   Experiments show that the time taken to evaluate these doesn't depend on the
   types or the sizes of the arguments, so we just use functions which consume a
   number of integer arguments and return a constant integer. -}
