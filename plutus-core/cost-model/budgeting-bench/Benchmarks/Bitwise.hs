{- | Costing benchmarks for bitwise bytestring builtins and integer/bytestring conversions. -}

  bytestrings (up to size 160 / 1280 bytes) and then again with a set of large
  inputs (up to size 1600 / 12800 bytes).  In the final budgeting benchmarks we
  mostly go up to size 150 (= 1200 bytes).

{- Experiments show that the times for big-endian and little-endian
   `byteStringToInteger` conversions are very similar, with big-endian
   conversion perhaps taking a fraction longer.  We just generate a costing
   function for big-endian conversion and use that for the little-endian
   conversion as well.  A quadratic function fitted to inputs of size up to 150
   gives a good fit and extrapolates well to larger inputs. -}

{- We have four possibilities for integer to bytestring conversions: they can be
 big- or little-endian, and they can also be of bounded or unbounded width.
 Experiments show that all of these take about the same time, with the bounded
 big-endian conversion taking a few percent longer than the other three
 possiblities.  We just benchmark that and use the model for all of the
 possibilities.  The bounded conversions can require some extra work to pad the
 result to the required width, for example if we ask to convert the integer 2 to
 a bytestring of width 1000.  We use a quadratic costing function which uses
 only the size of the integer, but this is safe because the implementation uses
 a single function call to generate the padding and experiments show that the
 time required for this is negligible in comparison to the conversion time.
 It's important to make sure that the memory cost does take account of the width
 though.  The sample we use gives us bytestrings up to 8*150 = 1200 bytes long.
 This is well within the 8192-byte limit. -}

{- For `andByteString` with different-sized inputs, calling it with extension
semantics (ie, first argument=True) takes up to about 5% longer than with
truncation semantics for small arguments and up to about 15% for larger inputs.
Fitting t~min(x,y) gives a reasonable prediction for small values of x and y but
this doesn't extend too well to larger values.  There are two factors in play:
with extension semantics there's less copying work to do but more alloction work
(which is a lot cheaper).  If we fit a model of the form t~pmin(x,y) then this
accounts for the copying but not the allocation.  if we add a factor for copying
as well (t ~ pmin(x,y) + abs(x-y)) then we get a model that extends well to
larger data.  Equivalently we can fit t~x+y to the data for y<=x, but then we'd
have to swap the inputs for y>x.

A model for t~x+y does a good job though: we get within +/-5% for the small data
and -20% to +5% for big data. We could also try fitting t=a+bx along x=y for the
small data and then extrapolate that to a/2+ b/2(x+y) elsewhere.

We assume that the costs of `orByteString` and `xorByteString` are the same as
those of `andByteString` and re-use the `andByteString` costing function for
those.

{- The `writeBits` function takes a bytestring, a list of positions to write to,
   and a boolean value to write at those positions.  Benchmarks show that the
   time taken by `writeBits` depends mostly on the number of updates (and not on
   the length of the bytestring), although it may take a little longer to write
   bits with larger indices.  We run benchmarks involving increasing numbers of
   updates to 1024-byte bytestrings, always writing the highest-indexed bit to
   take account of this.  We use a fresh bytestring for each set of updates.

{- For small inputs `replicateByte` looks constant-time.  For larger inputs it's
   linear.  We're limiting the output to 8192 bytes (size 1024), so we may as

{- Benchmarks with varying sizes of bytestrings and varying amounts of shifting
   show that the execution time of `shiftByteString` depends linearly on the
   length of the bytestring and (to a much smaller degree) the size of the
   shift, except that shifts which involve shifting bits between bytes are
   significantly more expensive than shfts by a whole number of bytes.  For
   bytestrings of size 50 the ratio between the former and the latter is about
   1.5 and for size 400 it's about 4.  We could add a special case for costing
   whole-byte shifts, but for the time being we run benchmarks for a single-bit
   shift and fit a linear model to the time taken versus the length of the
   bytestring.  This gives a mmodel which is very accurate for small shifts and
   overstimates times for large shifts by maybe 4% or so, A model fitted to
   smaller data extrapolates very well to larger data.

{- The behaviour of `rotateByteString` is very similar to that of
   `shiftByteString` except that the time taken depends pretty much linearly on
   the length of the bytestring and the effect of the size of the rotation is
   negligible.  We could add a special case for costing whole-byte rotations,
   but for the time being we run benchmarks for a single-bit shift and fit a
   straight line to the time taken.  A model fitted to smaller data extrapolates
   well to larger data.

{- For `findFirstSetBits` the time taken is pretty much linear in the length, with
   occasional bumps.  Unsurprisingly the function takes longest for an all-0x00
   bytestring because it has to examine every byte in that case.  For costing we
   use 0x8000...00 just to avoid the all-zeros case in case someone attempts to
   optimise for that case at some time in the future.  For small data the worst
   case takes up to 8% longer than the best case (0x00..01) and for large data
   it can take up to 40% longer. A model based on small input sizes extrapolates
   well to results for large inputs. -}
