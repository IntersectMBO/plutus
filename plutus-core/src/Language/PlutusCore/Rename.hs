{- Note [Marking]
We use functions from the @markNonFresh*@ family in order to ensure that bound variables never get
renamed to free ones. This means types/terms/etc are processed twice: once by a @markNonFresh*@
function and once for the actual renaming. We may consider later to do some kind of meta-circular
programming trick in order to perform renaming in a single pass.
