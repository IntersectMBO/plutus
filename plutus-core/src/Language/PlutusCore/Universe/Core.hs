{- Note [Universes]
A universe is a collection of tags for types. It can be finite like

    data U a where
        UUnit :: U ()
        UInt  :: U Int

(where 'UUnit' is a tag for '()' and 'UInt' is a tag for 'Int') or infinite like

    data U a where
        UBool :: U Bool
        UList :: !(U a) -> U [a]

Here are some values of the latter 'U' / the types that they encode

        UBool               / Bool
        UList UBool         / [Bool]
        UList (UList UBool) / [[Bool]]

'U' being a GADT allows to package a type from a universe together with a value of that type.
For example,

    Some (ValueOf UBool True) :: Some (ValueOf U)

We say that a type is in a universe whenever there is a tag for that type in the universe.
For example, 'Int' is in 'U', because there exists a tag for 'Int' in 'U' -- 'UInt'.

{- Note [The G, the Tag and the Auto]
Providing instances for

    data Some f = forall a. Some (f a)

is tricky. There are several things to consider here:

1. the G: for some type classes we can provide an instance for @Some f@ for any @f@ generically.
Take for example @Show (Some f)@, we could implement it as

    instance (forall a. Show (f a)) => Show (Some f) where
        show (Some a) = "Some " ++ show a

(with `-XQuantifiedConstraints`). Unfortunately, that breaks @deriving (Show)@ for every data type
that has @Some f@ somewhere inside it and forces you to use a standalone deriving declaration for
each such data type, which is rather annoying, because instance contexts tend to get huge,
so it takes time to come up with them or to remember where to copy them from and they also occupy
a lot of space (text-wise).

Luckily, "Data.GADT.Show" provides

    class GShow t where
        gshowsPrec :: Int -> t a -> ShowS

    gshow :: GShow t => t a -> String

which allows us to define a 'Show' instance for 'Some' as

    instance GShow f => Show (Some f) where
        show (Some a) = "Some " ++ gshow a

so @GShow f@ is basically an encoding of @forall a. Show (f a)@.

2. the Tag: for some type classes we can get away without providing the G version of a type class,
e.g. 'Hashable' is handled like that:

    instance Closed uni => Hashable (TypeIn uni a) where
        hashWithSalt salt (TypeIn uni) = hashWithSalt salt $ encodeUni uni

    instance Closed uni => Hashable (Some (TypeIn uni)) where
        hashWithSalt salt (Some s) = hashWithSalt salt s

where

    class Closed uni where
        encodeUni :: uni a -> [Int]
        <...>

So as long as for each type of a universe you know its encoding as a sequence of integer tags,
you can hash any type from the universe via that sequence. 'Serialise' is handled in a similar way.

The 'Hashable' type class is also interesting in that we do not provide a generic instance for
any @Some f@. This is because @f@ can be anything of kind @* -> *@ and we only have 'encodeUni' for
universes. In order to stress that the @f@ in this instance has to be a universe we use
the 'TypeIn' wrapper:

    instance Closed uni => Hashable (Some (TypeIn uni)) where

This allows us to hash a type from a universe and a value of a type from a universe in different
ways. The latter instance looks like this:

    instance (Closed uni, uni `Everywhere` Hashable) => Hashable (ValueOf uni a) where
        hashWithSalt salt (ValueOf uni x) =
            bring (Proxy @Hashable) uni $ hashWithSalt salt (Some (TypeIn uni), x)

    instance (Closed uni, uni `Everywhere` Hashable) => Hashable (Some (ValueOf uni)) where
        hashWithSalt salt (Some s) = hashWithSalt salt s

Here we hash a 'ValueOf' value as a pair of a type from a universe and a value of that type.

Another type class for which a generic @Some f@ instance doesn't make sense is 'NFData'.
For universes we define

    instance NFData (TypeIn uni a) where
        rnf (TypeIn uni) = rnf $ encodeUni uni

    instance NFData (Some (TypeIn uni)) where
        rnf (Some s) = rnf s

i.e. to fully force a type from a universe it's enough to encode the type as a sequence of integer
tags and fully force that sequence.

3. the Auto:

When we can manually provide an instance for a type class, the two previous approaches work nicely.
But for a type class like 'Lift' we really want to use the deriving mechanism in order not to mess
with the hairy internal representation ('Exp' and stuff). But 'deriveLift' (and 'makeLift') calls
'lift' under the hood while we want it to call 'glift'. So we define a newtype wrapper ('AG') that
implements 'Lift' in terms of 'GLift', insert the 'AG' constructor in the right place and invoke
'makeLift' which calls 'lift' on 'AG' internally, so the 'lift' gets elaborated to 'glift'
as we want it to.

And even though we can manually write 'Show' instances, they're handled in the same automated way
below, just because the derived instances handle precedence (and thus insert parentheses in right
places) out of the box.

We should be able to use the same strategy for every type class @X@ when a @makeX@ function
(analogous to 'makeLift') is available.
