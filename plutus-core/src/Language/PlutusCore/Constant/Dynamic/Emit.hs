-- | Feed the provided continuation with a function tracing a value to the outside of the
-- continuation where traced values get collected in a list.
--
-- If the tracing function is used in pure code via 'unsafePerformIO' and a @b@ returned by the
-- continuation is not forced inside the continuation, then no traced values will be collected as
-- no computation will occur. It is however not too late to force the resulting @b@ outside of the
-- continuation and reference the list of traced value afterwards. We don't attempt to force
-- anything ourselves, because the caller may want to force the resulting @b@ to WHNF or to NF or
-- not to force at all and just not trace anything if the result of the continuation is not used.
--
-- This function does not stream values lazily. There is a version that allows for lazy streaming,
-- but we do not have it here because it's way too convoluted.
-- See https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/pull/336 if you do need lazy streaming.
