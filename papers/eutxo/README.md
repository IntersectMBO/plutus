# The Extended UTXO model

This paper presents some extensions to the UTXO blockchain ledger
model which increase the expressivity of the model, allowing us to
implement general state machines and enforce invariants across entire
transaction chains.

The paper was presented at [WTSC'20](https://fc20.ifca.ai/wtsc/).
