# Multicurrency EUTXO

This paper adds multicurrency support to the [Extended UTXO](../eutxo)
blockchain ledger model and shows how user-defined tokens can be used
to extend the capabilities of state-machine-based smart contracts.
See also our paper on [multicurrency support in the standard UTXO model](../utxoma).
