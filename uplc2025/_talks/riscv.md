By leveraging a RISC-V implementation of the CEK machine and a new serialization format, we are able to compile Untyped Plutus Core (UPLC) scripts into executable RISC-V binaries. This pipeline enables efficient execution of Cardano-style smart contracts on Bitcoin via technologies like BitVMX, where the CEK evaluator is ahead-of-time compiled to RISC-V. We discuss the design choices, implementation challenges, and potential for cross-chain interoperability.
