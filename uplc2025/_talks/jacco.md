The formal verification of an optimising compiler for a realistic programming language is no small task. Most verification efforts develop the compiler and its correctness proof hand in hand.
Unfortunately, this approach is less suitable for todayâ€™s constantly evolving community-developed open-source compilers and languages.
I will discuss an alternative approach to high-assurance compilers, where a separate certifier uses translation validation to assess and certify the correctness of each individual compiler run.
I will also demonstrate that an incremental, layered architecture for the certifier improves assurance step-by-step and may be developed largely independently from the constantly changing main compiler code base.
This approach to compiler correctness is practical, as witnessed by the development of a certifier for the PIR-to-PIR pipeline of the Plinth compiler in the Rocq prover.
